Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
Which one?
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
Stuart?
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
Thank you.
A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
Yes, sir, name, please?
Do you have a reservation?
I'm sorry, sir.  We only seat by reservation.
Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
No, not sound.
His what??
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Four
Yes.
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Extremely well.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
Are you busy?
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Would you like a sandwich?
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Ooh!
Look, Doctor!
But who was playing it?
Perhaps we'd better leave.
And look at this, Doctor!
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
A god?
I know.
Raise the platform, hurry!
Reputation.  Reputation!
I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
I think you've done it, master.
It looks that way.
What are you going to do?
Do you think you can sing it?
Yes -- quickly, dear!
This is not the finals -- just sing!
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
All right -- give it to him!
Give him the sedative!
Did you do it?
Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
Good night!
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
Not fooling around.
I see what you mean.
I know Frederick.
Of course not.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
And Elizabeth has hers.
But, after all, you have yours.
And I have mine.
Why don't we talk inside?
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I will.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
MMMMmmmmm!
Are you ready for me?
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.
What's that tune that you're playing
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
Hello there.
How's everything?
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?
... It's.
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
MMMmmmmmm.
Frederick Frankenstein?
Are you putting me on?
And do you also say Fro dereck?
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
I see.
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
Are these your bags?
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
There.
There wolf!  There castle!
I thought you wanted to.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
The wockers with the knockers.
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
Home.
I wonder what's got into them?
Fro-derick!
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
Just putting up some tea.
What?
What?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Did you see anyone else down here?
What is this place?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is?
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
Could be worse!
Could be raining!
I have a pretty good idea.
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Was he any good?
Hmm!
That's not bad.
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
It's always been one of my favorite names.
Thank you, Master.
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
Throw the second switch!
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
More, do you hear me?
Throw the third switch!
You can't win 'em all.
Cold!  Cold and dead!
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
You'll be getting me sad next.
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
But you did -- I just heard it.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Original.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Yes.
Why?
I'm not trying to be funny.
... I'm glad that's...
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
Act casual!
What did you find out?
Where is he?
All right -- where is she?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
Maybe...if you get here on time.
That's what we're paid for.
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
What???
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
There's only one way.
Come on, big fellow!
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
Yes?
A piece of what?
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
My father was a sick man.
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
How old are you, young man?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
But your grandfather's work, sir...
Dr. Frankenstein?
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
How long will this whole thing take?
I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...
Why did you do that?
Break that old man's violin.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
Yes, sir.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
It seems fine.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
Yes!... the laboratory.
May I have it, please?
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
This is the only library I know of.
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
Will there be anything else?
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
You have your tickets?
And your passport?
Call me from New York before you leave??
Promise??
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Will you miss me?
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
I hope you like large weddings.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Does that mean you love me?
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Goodbye, darling.
Darling!
Surprised?
Love me?
Darling!?!
Ready, darling?
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
All right then!
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
That's a tough choice.
I suppose you're right.
Good night.
Darling!
Surprised?
Miss me?
What in God's name are you doing?
What?
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
Is it that music?
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
Yes, sir.
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
Yes, sir.
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
Frederick Frankenstein?
And who might you be?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
What was your grandfather's name?
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
Oh, shit.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
Is that so?
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
I lost him.
It was Xavier's people.  They knew.
A piece.  Only a piece.
Enough for a test.
ALIVE.
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
If she held on any longer she could have.
What am I doing here?
Who?
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
The point of what?
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
Now that's Magneto talking.
I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
To find Rogue.
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
I'll go.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
I do love a good check mate.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
Where am I?
What are you going to do?
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
You mutant bastards...
Gosh, I hope so.
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Senator?
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
Anything else I can get you?
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
If necessary.
You should always work with a spotter.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
What do you say?
Let go.
He's uptight.
He takes himself seriously.
Logan, do you see this ring?
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
How long have you been in Alaska?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
Scott.. I -
What are you talking about?
If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
We have to find Magneto.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
What's that?
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
Uh-huh.
It's too far.
Jean... can you?
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
What does that mean?
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
I wish I could go.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
That's the guy.
Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
When else are you gonna do it?
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
Of course.
This is a gift. From me to you.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
Had to do what I had to do.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
You wanna see my politics?
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
That was for Anders.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
What's so damn funny?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
Help me with this guy.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
Sit down.
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
Nice hops.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Dude, what are you doing here?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
Sorry, "dude".
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
I can see that. Why?
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
Alright, so I'll get more.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
They come in any other styles or colors?
That one I'm real familiar with.
Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
Nothing. He had two days.
What are you doing?
What was that for?
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Viktor! Stay the course.
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
Yorgi asked me to.
Go to hell.
Mind your business.
Where are you going?
I was invited. What's your story?
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
That right? Why's that?
We hung out last night, remember?
Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Go to hell!
What are you?
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
They tell me you're an American agent.
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
What's that?
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
When can I see you again?
Are you alright?
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
What are you doing with the Ivans?
Where are we going?
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
Aren't you afraid?
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Where's he headed?
Where'd the damn truck go?!
Toadies right behind.
You okay?
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
You can't talk to it?
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
What game is that?
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Like what?
Whatchu doing here?
That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
What do you have?
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
How will you fix it?
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
But programmable. And expendable.
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
Who the hell are you?
What is this place?
Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "walked" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
Is that a fact?
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
What do I get out of it?
You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along.
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
Up yours.
Is that all?
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
Thanks.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Yes it does.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
New information.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
You're making a big --
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Adrian.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
He's a little farther gone every time.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
What about you?
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
I'm sorry about Blake.
I don't know their real names.
I don't know their real names!
Then why don't you ask him?!?
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
What does this mean?  What does it --
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
Am I free to go?
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Jon??  You mean he's --
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
I can fix it.
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
So do I.  So do you.
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
. . . That was quick.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
What new information?
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Where's Laurie?
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --

Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
His what?
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Old?
. . . What?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
-- What is it.
Laurie --
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
Memory lane.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
Antarctica??
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
Don't look.  Turn around.
Okay!
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
They're following us.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
They're practically on us . . .
What?
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
What's he doing?
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
Where did he go?
Those cars.  What year is this??
Dan -- what do we do now?
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
No.  I just wanted you to --
Good night.
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
And what if you�re wrong?
What if you�re wrong??
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Blake?  Dead?
I'm here, Laurie.
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
Mm hmm.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
Collect me?
Jon, no -- I can't --
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
You -- you know about me and Dan?
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Because --
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
You're the only human being I care for.
I won't do that.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
What -- am I --
It�s very strange.  Time�s flowing backwards . . .
The south pole.  Time�s flowing backwards.
Veidt�s complex.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
Hi, Jon.
The bearer of bad news.
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
What's your theory?
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Walter --
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
A whore fucking.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
We don't know that.
Had a lot of blood in him.
No idea who's behind this?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
Why?  What's the problem?
I would like to use the bathroom --
What?!
We�ve been pawns in someone�s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
Do we have the range of Renard�s plane?
Marvellous.
It�s heading for the oil terminal.
Any word from him?
Warm.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It�s what you wanted.
He was a...good lover?
This is the end.
Everything�s under control up here.  Are you ready?
I�ll send someone out.
Perhaps this isn�t the time...
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn�t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
Someone will come.
What?
No! Bond!
What is this place?
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Valentin Zukovsky.
You, of course. I need some information.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat�s nest.
See?  You�re upsetting my customers. What do you want?
What?  This is not possible.
Where did you get this?
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
What�s your business with Elektra King?
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn�t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
Now...where were we?
No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
And the payoff on the tables?
Where�s the sub going?!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
Istanbul.
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
How appropriate.
I met you at my father�s funeral.
I haven�t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don�t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I�m not sure he knew that.
Partially, yes.
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He�s decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
It�s my father�s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
It�s not the pin your father wore. It�s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
The killer doesn�t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn�t want to see you take over...
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King�s daughter.
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
You don�t take no for an answer, do you?
Oh my God...we�re buried alive...
I can�t stay here.
No!  It will cave in!
I can�t stay.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I�m a coward.
What is it?
James...
Then take me with you.
I don�t want to be safe!
Vodka martini.
What the hell are you doing here?
If this little show is for my benefit, I�ll take you home right now.
I understand it�s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
How did you survive?
What�s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
What are you talking about?
...what?
Are you saying...Renard is the man who�s trying to kill me?
I don�t know what you�re talking about!
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn�t have to sleep with you to find that out.
You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
You do what you have to do, but I�ve called in M.  She�s en route from London even now.
Not interested.
Soon she�ll be everywhere.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
You turned Renard.
So you killed your father.
Was this all about the oil?
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I�m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather�s name, the glory of my people.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
One... last... screw?
Beautiful, isn�t it?
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
A word? I�m sure by now he�s engineered a hostile takeover.
He was my father.
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
Indeed.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  She�s beautiful isn�t she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
It�s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldn�t have done it without you.
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
Your last chance. Take the money.
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
I can�t tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He�s a man of great integrity.
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  I�ve known that girl all her life. I�m not sure she knows what she�s walking into.
I�ve scheduled a medical for you.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
Who told you to look at Elektra�s files?
You haven�t been given an assignment in this case.
I�m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
It�s a message.  He wants us to know he�s back.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra�s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I�d do the same again.
The doctor who saved him couldn�t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he�s a dead man.
�That which does not kill me makes me stronger.�
He�s not through yet. Renard doesn�t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there�s more coming in. He�s working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
The worm on the hook again.
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
The inside man?
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won�t just be two weeks out of action.
It�s just a scratch.
Then maybe I�d be... open to that.
...yes?...
You new?
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I�ve heard them all.
What happened to Len Tashka?
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we weren�t around, they�d have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
Here�s your imposter. He�s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They�re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they�re flying it wherever he tells them.
So who are you?
They won�t get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
Alright then, brunch.
Then it�s no longer a bomb?
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
What the hell are you talking about?
Who�s she?
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
What is it?
Nuclear.
Made to look just like an accident.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
Elektra would control it all.
If I don�t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden�s Tower, M is dead.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
He�s going to insert the plutonium.
Like riding a bike.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
But what if...
We�ve got to get out.
I love Christmas in Turkey.
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
Yes -- ....
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
-- Ruined my exit!
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
Yes.
Well, I --
Well, I --
Well, I --
You promised us real things -- a real...
Th.D.?
Beautiful!  What an echo!
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
No, sir!
That's right.
To Oz?
Animals that -- that eat straw?
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Come on -- come on --
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Emerald City!
Dorothy!
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Yes.
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Oh, did - did you see that?
You know something?
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
It's a whozis?
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Well, that's you all over.
Now, now, don't fret.
We'll get you together!
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
Oh --
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
No, you don't.
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
Yeah --
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
...Tin Man!
...junk!
Quiet!
...of the West.
Mr. Gale!
I want to see you and your wife right away....
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
You mean she bit you?
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
Oh, scared, huh?
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Dorothy!
Not even a rhinoceros?
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
It's a whatzis.
Whozat?
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
Yeah --
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
You don't neither --
Yeah.
Don't push!
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
I don't know.
What's the matter?
Somebody pulled my tail.
I -- Oh --
What was that?
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
Fine.  He's got a plan
Yeah. Me?
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Now...
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
This way!  Come on!
Yeah!
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
Ah --
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
It's too late!  There they....
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
...don't talk.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Ohhhh --
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
My, it's good to be....
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
They would?
Where's Kansas?
You're going to see a Wizard?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Yes -- that's true.
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
To Oz?
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
Yes.  Oh -- look --
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Here -- here --
Yes --- there.
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
...along.
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
Yes -- there --
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Oh --
Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Did you just hear what I just heard?
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
No, but you tried to.
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
You're right -- I am a coward.
Oh.
A home --
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Yes -- let's run!
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Who's her?  Who's her?
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
I'll be home in time for supper!
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
How about a hippopotamus?
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
I'd sooner wait outside.
Because I'm still scared!
Ohh!
Huh?  What'd he say?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Did they hurtcha?
They're coming back!
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Oil can.....Oil can....
Oil can....
My mouth -- my mouth!
Oh...
...Oh, did that hurt?
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh --
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh! Oh!
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
We might.
And bears!
It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Oh --
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
I knew you would!
You've had plenty of time already!
Yes...!
Look -- it ticks!
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Now you're seeing reason.
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Yes --
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Oh --
Aw, come, come, come --
Oh --
Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
Oh -- yes.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
That's right.  What's she doing?
Oh --
Me?
Uh-huh.
...room --
...paper?
...bed.
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
Oh!  Well....
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
I thought you said she was dead.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
...Toto, too?
Oh, now?
Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
...didn't you?
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Ahh!  Ah!
No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Uhhhh -- yes...
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
Oh ....
Ohhh!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Oh --
Our echo.
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
...have you come back?
Oh ....
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
To see?
If she?
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
Yes.
Yes.
Aunt Em!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Oh -- all right.
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Yes, darling.
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Is this where we're going?
Momma... are they angry with us.
I don't want to stay here.
I wish dawdie was with us.
No, you listen. Get out!
You have no right here!
You might have killed him!
Get back in there.
She say where he is?
What about Carter?
Lean on him.
They don't have any shit.
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Who was that man?
Is the English dead?
Looks dead...
I know.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
I have committed no sin.
That is idle talk.
I am not a child.
I will be the judge of that.
You shame yourself.
Everything okay?
John said you're Amish.
Oh.
You didn't have to...
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
What's so funny?
God, Fred...
No? Why not?
Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
Not yet.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know � anybody who knows John � knows that's a goddamn lie!
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
I don't know where he is.
You know where he is.
You'd lie to protect him.
You admit you're lying?
You're the first one he'll contact.
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
Anybody know about this?
Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens �
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Listen to me � Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
I hear you.
It's me.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
I'm coming.
You hear me?
That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
Say again?
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
There'll be another train.  The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
What was that?
Now what's the problem?
Whacking?
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
No you're not �  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
I would not be too sure.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
No.
Oh? Anything else?
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
But why would they murder...
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Where are you taking us now?
You couldn't wait until morning?
I was wrong.
I can't.
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
But why?
But �
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Does anybody know I'm here?
How long?
How long have I been here?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Tell him his tea stinks.
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Your husband's?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Buttons are Hochmut.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Where's the nearest telephone?
No. I'd want a public phone.
I'm going this morning.
I know what he said.
The... bullets?
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
We had some lemonade and he left.
You know carpentry?
What else can you do?
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.
But... You may not be well enough.
When will you be going?
Won him over just like that.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I was being foolish?
You're so sure of that?
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
That's God's way!
I want you to take this... to remember by.
How reliable is this kid?
Amish.
What have you got?
So one of them got to him.
You know who?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Just us.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
What's your first move?
Who else knows?
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
Don't try me, Johnny!
I saw him.
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
He was... like him.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
Tell you what � I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Hey, Sam...
What's that, Sam?
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.  You look plain, Book.  Very plain.
Try the house.
It's been a while.
Your hole is healed, then?
Nail it!
Everything is all right, John.
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Where's Timmy and Buck?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Oh sure, Fred.
They're Amish.
John, I don't understand any of this.
John, why?...
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Milking?
I've seen pictures.
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
You're the guardian, aren't you?
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
This is not going well.
Talk!  Say something!
Hey, careful there!
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
Obviously.
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
She needs to be changed.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
Madmartigan.
I don't know much about him.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
I'm not going in there.
Are you sure?
We gotta follow them.
Get back here, Rool!
Who are you!  Who are you!
What do you want!
Kill him!
Kill him!
No.
You must learn magic.
Then I will teach you.
What do I need for that?
I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
I'm all finished.  Now what?
How am I gonna do that?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
What's the magician's weapon?
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
The art of transformation!
Me!
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Shhhhh!
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
His will.
I just wanted to test it first.
Tir Asleen.
How??
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
Just do it!
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Time is running out.
Patience, Willow.
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Can't we keep it, Dada?
Dada, what's a daikini?
Are you scared?
What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
Good.  How long will it take?
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
I have to give this baby to some- body.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Are you okay?
I don't know.
Farmer.
You all right?
Smells like a battle.
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
You hear trouble.
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
You gotta promise to feed her.
Fresh goat's milk.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
You!!
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Nursemaid?!
Time to leave.
Because she's sick.
I thought you had her!
Elora Danan!
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides?
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
You?
I'll help you...!
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
Did she ask about me?
Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?
Willow!
Well what did she say?
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
Want me to carry Elora?
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
She's a bird, Willow.
Watch it!
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
He turned that monster into stone!
I will!  But I need help!
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
As above, so below.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
I can't.
I can't.
Why not?
You're not a woman.
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Say what?
Because it's true.
Sorsha.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
It's a matter of great importance to me!
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
Yes...?
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
You are very important, Willow.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
They look like acorns.
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
You managed alright.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
You're chasing a dream.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
Thank you, friend.
Well?
When are they coming?
In an hour they're gone!
You're not going to use it, are you?
Right.
Yes!
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
Are you all right?
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
This is something.
Now it's a bomb.
I beg your pardon?
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
You're not that big.
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
Philistine.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
Good work.  Really.
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
Nicely said, sir.
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
And now the job's yours.
On my way to Denver...
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
French?
French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Private train?
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Oh, I would hope not.
I've had some practice.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
You bring the best out in a man.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
A new friend?
Anyone?
Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
But it only has six legs.
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
J. S. Bach.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Put them all together and what do we have?
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
"Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
You need that real often?
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Aha!
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Limestone quarry?
Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
Prepare what?
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Yes.  Now, observe....
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
What was all that back there?
All that jumping and kicking.
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
At least I tried something.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
That's right... That's good.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Well... that, too.
So... what happened?
Uh... how long ago was this?
You might have mentioned you had that.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
Can you fill me in here?
Thank you.
You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
This is good.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
It is?
No record of him.
What's this?
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
It's not a guy...
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
I adjusted it.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
Oh, thank you.
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
I know!  I know!
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
There's only seventy-eight.
It was in your book.
Are those just button buttons or...?
My hat is off to you, sir.
God in heaven, what is that?!
My God!  He's so excessive!
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Shit. Here we go again.
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Goodbye, Sandra.
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Put Kelly on too.
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
Are you mad at me?
That was about as grim as it gets.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
What?
What's wrong?
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
We?
How...
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
I had to go look for this coupon.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
Yes.
Yes.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
That's right.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
You mean this thing?
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Yeah, or get me drowned.
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
No.
It doesn't look like it.
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
You, Kelly, Sam.
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Davy.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Sam, for godsake.
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
Who is it?
Where is she?
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
But check this...
Good thinking.
Forget it.
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nellie Gail Ranch...
There's nothing for them to get.
I just want my life back...
Come on, let loose!
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Don't forget the car wash.
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
So, where you off to now?
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
Kelly...
Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
So you got my mom's money.
About six and a half million dollars.
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
Do it to ourselves?
Stick?
Yes.
Why can't you come...
You know what it takes.
I'm here.
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
Hello?
God, I've been calling you.
Duquette.  Forget him...
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
And you believe her?
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Say you love me.
No little girl can ever make me come.
You think that's wise?
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Sam!  Hi!
Whichever one I want.
You notice my new jumper?
I would hardly say you look like trash.
Kelly.  What is it?
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
Yes.  God, Mom...
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Where, the mall?
Is there some reason why you're here?
About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
You're out of your mind.
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Get off my property.
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
You can trust me.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
What brain?
Nothing.
I think we just need to get wasted.
Shit.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Lombardo ever come out here?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
Thank you, Jimmy.
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
A ride.  You want one?
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
What did you do then?
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
I said he did.
This wasn't my idea.
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
Are you crazy, Ray?
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Oh, Ray... no...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights.
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
You didn't cuff her?
The teeth, were they...
Why?
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
That bothers you?
Why is that?
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
So you were alone.
Did he come in with you?
At that point were you able to fight him off?
He did say something.
I've got that two o'clock in town.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
It's our job, Gloria.
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
The skinny brunette.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
Lombardo's settlement?
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
Unless what?
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
I net a guy in a bar.
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
You could say that.
We all have...
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
If you want company...
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Where's the body?
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
Will you do me one favor?
What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
How long?
Maybe she used another name.
I don't know what to say...
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
I know you do.
Take your time.
I understand.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
He was large?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
About Suzie?
He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
She still work there?
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
And the child...
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
You okay?
How soon can we get something?
Merritt, Forensics.
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
She's going to wash your Jeep?
You look pretty.
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
Talk to me Artie.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
This is insane.
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
How you doing, Artie?
In a hurry, are we?
Bad news.
I'm just a messenger.
It's about your parents.
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?
I have only one concern...
Of course I like girls.
As much as possible.
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
They said that? Really?  Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
Me? The King of Coitus?
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
I told you you could do it.
You were the new and improved you.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
My father must've been amazing.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
My job. Back off, Benedict.
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
I never figured you for a pimp.
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.
Rules are rules.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Well? Surprised?
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
Only the best for my mother.
I'll make you very proud.
But how would we pay our bills?
Oh. Goodness.
Like what?
But who would run the store?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
In what sense?
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
Me?
Really? You wanna write about me?
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Interesting.
You never know around here.
Is this an gritty expos� or a candy ass press release?
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
Well? What do you think of her?
You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
To the best hiding place in the world.
He didn't. He had it built.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
He phoned it in.
I doubt it.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
Your dad taught you everything.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
It's incredibly simple.
Eventually you'll let go.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
I know.
But you never do.
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
That's probably my office.
He's on the move?
Let's do it.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
Amen to that.
I'm trembling with excitement.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
That's refreshingly deviant.
I'm very aural.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Not a chance.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
Maybe someday.
That's hard to believe.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You think you're working with chimps here?
Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
Let your fingers do the walking.
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
James, what are you doing here?
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
It's really late...do your parents know where you are?
Most places are, Jimmy.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
Very funny.
My room?
It's not up to me.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
You want it in writing?
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
Are they okay?
I miss them, too.
You're a peach.
He was my Grandfather, too.
That's a crappy thing to say.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
You're on the next plane home.
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
I understand.
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
Can you believe that was me?
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
I-I don't have the keys.
You do know how to drive?
Want a lesson?
Got it.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
Some of them have to be automatics.
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
The one with the horses.
I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Hi ho, Silver.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
Hmmm?
Whatever you want.
Of course we were.
What do you want me to do?
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
You're way ahead of me again?
The lesson being?
I'm getting so good at this.
Of course we are.
Son.
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Whatever helps you cope.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
Well, good. Every little bit helps.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
It's okay. You need me?
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
Sweetheart, what is it?
Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
We miss you. We miss our son.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
You go first.
Well. The prom's coming up.
And I was wondering.
If you don't have...I mean...
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
But that smile.
So you'll think about it?
So that's a maybe?
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
You know...take the pictures?
Which you pulled, hard!
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
You have changed since second grade.
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces.  Are you hungry?
What gives, Don Corleone?
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
Never say never.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
See? Did you see that?
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.
You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
That's crazy talk.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
And nobody knows you're a virgin!  Aw, who are we kidding...
Astronomical.
Well, Dad said...
Maybe he got promoted.
Cut it out, before you break something!
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
Perv.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Not ever. Never.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
Yeah, whatever.
I better go, Dad.
What is it now?
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
And some really fast cars.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
Give me those!
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
I love those springy head puppies!
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
You got everything you ever wanted.
Dr STECKLER?
INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
I'll be sure to...
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Yes - one please.
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
No - a dentist
No worries
Don't worry about it -
And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
Oh...
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
That's good
Yes, that would be nice - I'll call round some time...
It's been what, three years?
So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
Well, what do you think?
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
What's wrong with you?
What?
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
I want you out now
I'm your landlady
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
It doesn't mention 'females only'
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
Tell me - ELLEN CARTER  Forgive me for being so pushy, but aren't you a novelist? Didn't you write that terrific book - 'The Color of Fear'?
The touch?
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
I'm sorry?
It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
Sugar?
So what do you do?
And how long have you been a dentist?
And how many people have you killed?
You don't know?
Where do you kill them...
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
No she didn't...
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
I don't want to talk about it -
I don't know...
I don't know...
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
I have something I have to show you...
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
Why should I?
And how did it feel to be rid of him
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
Then make it stop...
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
Nothing could be better...
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
Open it...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
Out - I may be some time
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
I am sorry...
Yes - I suppose so...
No thanks - 
He doesn't need to...
What was I supposed to do?
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
Don't you want me now LESLIE
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
BRIAN...
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
So there is only one key...
And it can't be forged?
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
All the time?
I know what you mean - I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening...
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
Which do you think is her best shot...
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
I'm sorry - I didn't think
I thought you were someone else
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
Sounds good - thank you
We'd better get to work on the papers.
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
Rowan Mayfair.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
He's got great hands.
I like him.  He can stay.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
On which planet...?
Go away, GODDAMNIT!
The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
If you like that type.
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
They like you ------- kids.
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
My jury's still out on that,
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
What do you see...?
Just one.  The bar's closed.
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
Rowan...
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
you're very --- different.
What else did you see- Michael...?
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
He fools around with his patients too.
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Captain's orders.
All I meant was -
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
I'm serious.  You don't -
Stop it.
Seems more like a year than a month.
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.
Mad. for each other.
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
- a witch.
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
Do you love me, Michael...?
I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
Let's see.
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
Hello..
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
Ro, how long have we known each other.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
Their what...?
Wanna snack...?
Hey - you're bleeding.
You look a little green.
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
Michael!
No.    This is unreal...
I love you too.
That's cause we're below sea level.
That's not funny.
Talking to me dear...?
- we made a fire.
Your beneficence.
You alright...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
When aid you get home last night...?
Yyou look terrible.  You're exhausted. You practically live at the goddamn clinic.    Even pregnant women who aren't doctors know that You can't -
Go ahead.
Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
Gotcha.
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
No.
Harder...
Harder...
Yessss...
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
There are things you will not tell him.
Like this...?
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
Always loved you..
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
Explain this to me --- violated...?
Made it...?
To love, you must be able to feel.
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...

I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
I bring her flowers too.
Go away!  I don't want you here.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
A girl...?
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
Do not tell me that!
I know that you're evil.
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
Then help me--- for his sake...
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Leave me alone!
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
I don't know what you are!!!
No!
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
Oh god...
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
Parents say he - uh - fell -
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
uh - then he - be just -
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
Help us.  Do what you can.
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
Who is this...?
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
When did she die...?
This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.
Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
I under5tand.  All the same
I had you sent away.
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
I don't want the -
Eighty million doll --- ?
What is it...?
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-
She didn't feel them
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
'He'...?
It wes a dream...!
Stop it!
ENOUGH!!!
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
You - are - a - murderer.
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
Giff - shuttup.    you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
Nothing worse than a common tool.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
Come.  There is a lot to read
A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
Michael, Rowan should -
What have the witches always asked of you...?
Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
Nothing was ever more false.
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
A spacial entity.  An organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence.
Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
There are two.
Two heartbeats.
But why would they do that...?
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
:Would you stop it!
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
Three weeks.
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
Norman Spencer.
Don't.
It's Saturday.
Yep.
Three o'clock.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
If you have to work...
How are you?
It's okay if you're not.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
You know what I mean.
You are...
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
It's just us now.
Tired?
Wanna fool around?
Did you...
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Maybe we should just...
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
I'll be there.
Of him I think.
More or less.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
To make sure she's all right.
That's not what I'm sug--
But what if something happens?
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
I know.
I just wish you could have heard her.
Promise?
Mmnph.
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
Hi.
Oh.
No, no.  It's fine.
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
In the house.  I was scared.
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
I don't know.  Just...whispering.
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
Really?
You are so brilliant.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
"...for my father."
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Did you tell her?
You didn't?
Sorry.  You understand.
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Get down!  He'll see.
Shhhh.
What?
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
Our house.
It's a flare.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
It's a ghost.
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
See?
I didn't do that.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Dressed?
When?
Oh.
Tonight?
When you do this, I swear...
...like it never even happened...
What are you doing?
Five minutes?
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
There we go.
I don't need a shrink.
Norman...
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
I never said...
Are you lonely?
What are you doing out here?
This is the Feur thing?
How do you know this?
Who did?
How did you--
What?
What are you...?  No.
Sabotage?
The accident...?
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
I will NOT.
Claire, please...
Then where is she?
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Do I have everything?
Call ya later.
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
I felt you...looking through me...
You told me that I was...
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
I...
In the living room...
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
But I don't remember.
What's wrong with me?
Not personally.
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Yes.  The ghost.
Stop...
...Please stop...
STOP IT!
Wouldn't go that far.
What's the matter?
Since when?
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
Who?
STOP IT!
What?
Claire--
Oh God...
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
That's not what I'm sayi--
Claire, please don't...
I never asked you to quit!
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
To Caitlin!!
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
I tried to break it off!
Claire...
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
She did it.
Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
It's alright.
She's gone.
She can't be here without me.
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
The leaves...
Look for antiques...
Adamant.
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Do you know it?
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
Nothing.
You don't have to do that.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
Shhhh.
What?
How you holding up?
You are?
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Well good.  So you're human.
Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
Yep.
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
You think he killed her?
Know what I think?
Seance.
Telling you...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Someone's there.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Sit down here.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
This.
I don't know.
Shhh.
M-E...
It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
Jody, wait.
I think so
It's alright.
Does Norman know?
What?
Then what was it?
Something was there.  You saw it.
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
But Claire--
Okay.  Okay.
Oh God...you knew.
Adamant?
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
I'm a terrible friend.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
I don't know.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
I know.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
Jody he was lying.
I guess not.
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
Wow.
We know each other.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
...just so she could cut them off.
I came in from my room...
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
You should have heard her play.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
Yeah.
You know where she is?
Please leave me alone.
Claire.
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
You look a little old for a student.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
I don't know.
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
They're calling me in to work.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
What was her major?
Who are you?
You're the flower lady.
I've seen you.  From the window.
Hello?
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
I can't, no, no, I can't...
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
I've never even met you.
This fence...it's so...
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
I wanted to apologize.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Right.  I'm sorry.
Very much.
Thank you.
No.
You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
What?
Um...sure.
You must think I'm pathetic.
Yes?
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
This really isn't a good time.
She isn't here.
I don't know.
I have to go.
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
Of course.  You must be so proud.
Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Almost.
I'm sorry?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Toward the end.  You remember?
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Who's idea was it?
I didn't want to come.
Because he was worried about me.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
No.
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
You're joking.
Mm-hmm.
How do you know it's a she?
What does she look like?
Do you have any idea who she is?
Fine.
What?
You think that'll help?
Are you humoring me?
How?
What's happening to me?
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
Your friend saw them.
You think you influenced her?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
She said, "You know."  That I know.
No.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
Do you have a scarf?
Yes?
I know that.
Of course you will.
That was very good.
Why?
No, he wouldn't.
That's not true.
He loves you very much.  He just--
Are you mad at me?
I miss you.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
I started seeing things.
Did you?
What?
Stop saying things so loud!
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
YES!
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
Hi there Sarah
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Well?
Six six and six
Sell my soul?
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Can this be stopped?
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Right.
Right behind you.
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
Haven't we been doing our homework.
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
Then why do you still like her?
I know what you mean.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
That's not what you said last night.
A little?
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Well?
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Sarah listen to me.
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Tony and China?
Hello?
No Jonathan.
She went to a waxwork party
Can I give her a message?
Your books Master Loftmore
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
And uh, your nicotine sir
Allow me sir
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
We're all here, and ready sir!
Good evening sir.
Weird and tiny huh?
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Would you like a closer look?
Yes, I guess you're right
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
Anybody want another drink?
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
He still likes you
He did?
Businessman?
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
Yeah 
But?
What's that?
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
It's over you, Gordon.
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
Old values. Buy.
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
How you doing Buddy?
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
You could have a great beach house for that.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
I gather you're a decorator.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Upper West Side.
Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
Break it.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
You really do believe in destiny?
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
Yeah, almost...
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
And what do you want?
Well, why stop at that?
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Do you think you're ready?
I'll let you know.
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
Hi.
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
So what firm you with, pal?
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
...I can't even see it...
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
No sir, that would've been illegal...
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
Excuse me sir.
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly...  ...about 50 thousand.
What? How do you know about my father?
Yes...
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
I remember that deal. You were involved?
I don't understand.
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
What about hard work?
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
Allright. Wait here...
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work.
How much?
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
What the hell do you want?
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Are you with me Buddy?
Dump it.
Gordon.
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
What was that?
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Okay.
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
Yeah, right...
...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
All right, Bud... let's do it.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
So, where are we going?
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made...
What'd you tell him?
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
...thanks Natalie.
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me.
Speak English will ya.
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
...Got a 100 on me, you...
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right.
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
You sure about this FAA announcement?
The FAA announcement.
What brings you out here...
Don't start, alright.
Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
Whatever night you like.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
You speak for me, son.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
It concerns his future!
...well, see him?
Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle.
...gotta read my reports.

Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink?
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...
If I ever need surgery, get me the heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's never been used...Happy Holideals Harold...
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...

Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
It's tough to rhyme.
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
Jim Belushi...?
They guard our, <u>you</u> know ... "borders," night and day...

She is the victim of, she has been <u>relocated</u>, to, to, for the <u>terrorists</u>, the Government Labs...the, the... a <u>staging</u> area for their Atomic workshop.  They're torturing her family, because they have connections in Canada, which would permit the terrorists access to the American Border.

Too Texan.  Go with the stick.  Thanks.  <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why?
Why are they ...
The Canada Thing was a shuck.  A <u>shuck</u> -- wasted a day. What can you do with Canada?  Bears, mapleleafs, "sugar -on-Snow."  Lays there on the plate like a lox.
You got a guy, doesn't believe the War is... NO NO NO. An American Serviceman... A brave American Serviceman, is Left <u>Behind</u> ...  He is Left Behind.  He is discarded like an Old Shoe...

Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...

All the greater accomplishment.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.

Might, if I was asked... 
Of what?
...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...
We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
...a masterpiece...
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
Uh...
Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....

Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?

Uh huh...why?
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?
I'm tired.
He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
You can't tell this story.
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
No, I'm On Top of it...
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
You got a dime....?
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Hell of a show.  Hell of a job, Stan.
Naw, naw, we own the airways... 
No.  You're right.
A proud tradition.
What're you doing?
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Stanley.  Stanley... you knew the... Stanley.  You knew the deal when you signed <u>on</u>.
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
China.
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
Trade Re1ations.
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
How much...?
It can be documented that he displayed the...
There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last month.  One of them expressed an interest in a Frederick Remington bust.  The president took her into the oval Office, for a period...
...you the Press Office?
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
Is there a press conference today?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
Dartmouth
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
My name is Ronald Brean.
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
What's on your mind?
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
Why do they go to War?
Would you go to War to do that? 
Well, I have, too.  Would you do it <u>again</u>...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess <u>so</u>.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours. 
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
Heavy weather East of here.
I gotta get something, I gotta get ...shoes?  Ties? Hats...?  Good.  Good. 
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
We're locked into Albania.
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Where is he?
OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS.  THE STILL BAND.  A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH.
This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.
ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN.
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
ON THE GAS STATION OWNER, WHO HAS RETREATED TO HIS COUNTER AND PRODUCES A SHOTGUN, AND STARTS TO LOAD IT.
The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
ON CAIN, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
YOUNG PERSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT.
THE PLANE, IN A VIOLENT RAINSTORM, BUCKING WILDLY.  AMES, ON HIS KNEES, GATHERING UP THE PILLS, REPLACES THEM IN THE VIAL, SHAKES OUT TWO, AND GIVES THEM TO SCHUMANN.  WHO TAKES THEM.  MOSS THEN STRAPS HIMSELF BACK IN AND BREAN CONTINUES TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE.
"...where's my pill..."
ON SCHUMANN, WHO HAS CONE TO THE BACK OF THE COUNTER, AND IS EMPTYING THE CANNISTERS.
...where is my pill?
Oh, MiGod.
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
Who we got here...?
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
Who's got the story? 
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
All I need is the one day.
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
And you?
One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
It's going to be fine.  It's going to be ... you remember in 88, when...
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
I'll see you at National.
....we landing?
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
What's it gonna cost? 
Who would find out?
The American "people"?
Who's gonna tell'em.
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
...that's the general idea.
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
Why?
...<u>nothing</u>...
What did Albania ever do to us?
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
...where is the Back End coming from?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...

Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
<u>Yes</u>:  she is saying this in Albanian, <u>but</u> she's doing it not to be uh...  But because, she explains, that is the only way it can be understood by her Aged and Sainted Mother, who is standing there with her, dressed in her Traditional...
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.

How's your wife?

That's not bad at all.

Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
No, this is great.

We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."

Much more...uh, he have much more time to "serve?"

Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
He's not fine.
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"...

His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....

What if he's busy tonight?
What are you saying...
...on the way in.
It's the White House.
What about it?
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
Where's John?
The symphony of collision...
I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common �� we have such history together ��I've been thinking we should become friends.
Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
Why's that?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
Where did you plant the C-4?!
My...secret.
I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
Aren't you going to watch with me?
Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!
You actually listen to all those tapes?
A little less than yesterday.
John died.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it �� I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
Go to hell.
Enough!
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
What you need is a collar.
It wasn't a lie.
You all right?
You ready for this?
He was re�enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better �� to improve upon what was already done.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
What happened when he was 17?
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
What are you doing?
You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
I'm still working on it.
I've been in prison, remember?
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.
As a matter of fact, it is.
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
She's beautiful, you know?
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
What does that mean?
Sounds to me like a well�educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re�adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Don't get out of the car.
What the hell's going on?!
What did you do to those people?
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
You know I am.
Tell him.
I'm doing the best I can!
Start of what?
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
Real effective security...
Authority still makes me nervous.
Both.
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
That, or living through him...
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
Thanks.
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
You don't know?
Because this pain�in�the�ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
...I think so...You?
Lindenmeyer?
Sid?
Where the hell are you going?
How's your pulse?
Then shoot him already.
What do we do now?
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
Should I have?
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
It was you, wasn't it?
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
My God...
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
You catching my drift?
SID �� NO!!!
I am beautiful, aren't I?
How can I ever thank�you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
Glad to...
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
How should I know?
I wonder how that...
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
HEY!!!
I haven't been working on anything.
Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
You're...such a wimp.
It's nano�technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
It feels so.. .real.
This is supposed to be years away.
How do you kill it?
... and you get nano�death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
You embarrassed me in front of the highest�ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
Of the six prison inmates you've tested �� all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -� only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
You've had a year�and�a�half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
How does he know who I am?
What did Cox pull him out early for?
Don't remind me.
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
I was assured the problem was corrected.
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.
Not from in here.
What happens if I can't catch him?
How do you know I won't run?
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
What's the assignment?
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby� trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
I should have told him.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
You all right?
Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker,
He was a computer program for crissake.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
I'm getting by.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
What about them?
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?
I've seen worse.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
Fine �� you want to stay here?
Their weapons missing?
Where's my gun?
You son�of�a�bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
Then I guess we're even.
On my life, I promise you I will.
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
Whatever.
Catch him and your record's clean.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
Why would they be going there?
I wish we could hear them.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...
) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it.
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
You son-of�a�bitch, I'm going to kill you.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
Hello.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
Yes, yes, I saw you!
From the terrace.
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
How do you feel?
That will soon pass. It's nothing.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
She looks like a sick marrow!
Ask the priest, miss.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
Good, then let's go!
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
I've had a gutful of this.
Mother?
All right, Mother.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Mother.
I had so many things to think about!
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
This louse is looking for trouble.
But, miss ...
Yes!
Why are you crying?
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
A black bull!
Very, very?
He couldn't get through the door, then?
You little liar! Get out of here!
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
You cannot leave ...
There's been an accident.
Come with me.
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
How are you today?
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
Stop this!
It's for people!
And let him get run over by somebody else?
How much do you want for him?
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
Miss Viridiana ...
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
Well... is it so urgent?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
What are you doing here? Get out.
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
I'll be ready.
Yes. Why?
And ...your friend?
Is she coming back?
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know, sir.
And this chest?
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
Me, rich? Come on!
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot!
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
What's the matter with you?
Why the bad temper?
She's mad.
Let her do what she wants. She doesn't bother us in any way. She minds her business and we ...
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
What are you going to do?
You're happy, aren't you!
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
What are you thinking about?
She isn't my cousin.
How in hell does it wind up?
Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
Me?
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
It's very good.
That doesn't matter; I like it.
He was asking for it.
Ramona! Ramona!
How much is that?
That's fifteen by seven?
Good.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
And in the vegetable plot?
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
She won't even know.
Is it all right?
Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
Yes, sir.
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
How long are you staying?
Was that difficult to get?
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
You have no feelings toward ...
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
Come down here, you scamp.
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
You see, even the voice.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
What do you mean?
How did you know about that?
Yes, it is.
Never.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
And what do you know about life? When all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand.
And this innocent child.
You must think I am a monster.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!
You must think I'm mad.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Leave us alone, Ramona.
You're lying.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
Let me pass!
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
Are there many windows?
Then it's a respectable house.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
What's that?
What about them?
Which couch?
Take me there.
I'll come to you tonight.
Give them to Refugio.
Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
You'd like me to kill them?
Yes, yes.
Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
Good times.
She's dead.
Fucking desert.
Right.
Shut up Micheal.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
We will.
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
The post-Vegas Man.
Okay boys, smile!
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
Okay great. What will that be?
What song?
Oh I know that. How does it go...
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
That ought to be about the end of that.
No...No.
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
The first day.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
I have no idea.
Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
A move?
Greenpeace?
Where's Boyd?
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
All week long.
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
Where?
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
That's what I'm thinking.
That's just insecurity.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
It means she's insecure.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
You're not breathing right?
I don't care for him.
So?
Go for it.
I'm getting married...
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Where did you get that?
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
What is it?
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
Just kills me...
I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey.  And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out.  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead!
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
This is ridiculous.
Why can't we do it through the mail?
Can't we do it on the phone?
Why is this Kid staring at me?
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
What do you mean, you think so?
The wedding cake check?
Photographer?
Florist?
Caterer?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
You forgot the tent?
Why?
Why did you forget the tent check?
You can't play around with these tent people.
What else have you forgot?
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
Don't you dare.
Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
Well it's bad timing.
Right before the wedding?
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
He's a moron.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
What are you talking about?
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
Who else?
You don't like Moore? Since when?
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's quiet.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
He's a great chef.
You expect more what?
Time out.
That's absurd.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
You will not be common!!!
Of course.
With all my heart.
We've got problems here.
Seating problems.
Keith do not trivialize this.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Not padded ones.
You go down there.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
I need your help.
I need your help.
Do you love me?
Take care of those chairs.
Maybe.
I will.
Of course.
I love you.
Hello.
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
That's sweet.
Well you should.
Just a bit of organizing.
Yeah. Nesting.
Go have fun. Not too much.
Hello.
Where are you?
How late?
What about the chairs?
What okay?
The chairs.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
What's the word on the chairs?
Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
Well, can you come back inside?
Now?
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
No baby. We'll all be right in.
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Can we just talk this out?
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
I know.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Okay. Okay.
No.
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
Don't even.
What?
What kind of stupid question is that?
What are you talking about?
Who's dead?
You fucked a prostitute?
You killed a prostitute.
Call the police.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!
What money?
What does that mean?
Like how?
The only proof is those bodies.
Move the bodies.
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
What?
No...
But...
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
Are we supposed to?
May we have the rings please?
The rings?
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
The hell I did!
I never heard that.
Moore?
Oh really? Starbucks?
You hate women.
True.
You have a King fantasy.
And what happens when you can't?
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
Then what do they have?
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
There's my point exactly.
Take Mexico.
Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
They need leadership.
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
You said nobody would miss her.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Easy Micheal.
We're goosed.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Stop it!
Stop.
Give me the Valium.
How about my Fatburger?
You said that Boyd.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
We need padded chairs.
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Call 911.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
Oh God. This is insane.
Nobody knows she's here.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
I think we should say some words over the grave.
I'm talking about prayer.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
Easy Boyd.
He's cracked up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What?
I said, what have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
What?
I just want to get married.
What's your point?
Regarding what?
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
Suck my ass.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
What are you going to do?
What does that mean?
I don't know...
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
That's right.
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Fine? Fine what?
I'm serious.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
No I don't.
Your investment ideas never work out.
I don't think so Boyd.
But not tonight.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
He's right.
I got her arm.
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
What's your fucking point?
What's goosed?
He just had two.
He's too drunk.
What is it?
What?
She's not here.
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
So who's the lucky guy?
The groom?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
She's still working?
Sweet deal.
Great. Fine. Perfect.
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
Don't sweet lip me.
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
Lois please.
There's more.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
So. When is the wedding.
We'll be ready Adam.
That's one idea.
Real times.
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
Are you solid with that?
Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
Don't ever stare him down.
Don't eyeball your kids.
I know and I'm honored...
I know...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
No way.
I want you to hear me out.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
I got you.
Don't snap at them!
They're singing.
What?
Later.
Where's the candy?
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
Don't even start.
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
You don't know what you're doing.
What?
What are you talking about?
I'm calling the ambulance.
Calling the ambulance.
We have to call the ambulance.
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Stop it!
Just stop.
I'm calling the police.
Bury her out in the desert.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
Her fucking head was caved in.
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
What about the blood?
Have you ever done this before?
Sun rises at 5:52.
Wait. Wait a minute.
We can't do this.
No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
That is absolutely not true.
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
I am not flexible on this.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
What does that mean?
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Watch the tone fella.
Any time fat boy!
I can't do this.
At the seven-eleven.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
I got children. I've got a life.
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Sorry Fish.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
You're an asshole.
Multiple reasons.
I don't have to...
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
She's dead.
Playing?
Why was the floor wet?
Why?!
It's sacrilegious.
You're pathetic.
You're not a team player.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
The hell you do.
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
Eat my ass!
You're a loser.
You fucking bastard!
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
How ya doing?
What's that?
I said how's it going?
The stripper's here.
She's fucking hot!
Jesus.
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
Can't do what?
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted. 
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
I thought so!
How soon can it be altered?
Can we have it by tonight?
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
By... no... the name I do not remember. A rich man, a powerful man.  It is not an unusual story. She came from somewhere small, to the south of the city... some say from a mission settlement... young, yes; very young.  And she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man... wait... wait... Ives! His name was Ives!  Yes. And he took her and built for her this great house in the Western Addition... and there was a child. Yes. This was it. The child.
How?
Ow!!
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
More than you think.
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Why?
It wasn't your fault.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
It's where you belong.
Ah, Johnny-O...
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
I'm having one now.
Oh!
I've never run across one like that.
Uh-huh!
What a pleasant hobby.
That's following a train of thought.
Normal.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Three whole weeks.
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Sorry, old man. Work.
What.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
How?
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Okay.
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Yeah.
Who?
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Do you know him well?
All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
And she died...
For what?
Nothing to tell.
I'll take you home.
You haven't told me everything.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Think?  Well, what do you think?
Carlotta?
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Bye-bye!
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Where?
Oh?
Did you need it?
Oh?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Oh... this and that.
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
What have you been doing?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
No, not exactly. Want to see?
Is there something I can do for you?
Oh, yes!
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
Please answer my question.
What is her name?
Carlotta Valdes?
How long has she had the room?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
What car?
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
No...
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
At...
Why?
Where had you been before?
This afternoon.
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
You like it, too.
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
No.
Oh! Yes! Here!
I... didn't know where you lived.
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
My name is John Ferguson.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
Wander about.
One shouldn't live alone.
No... it's wrong.
What?
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
Oh! Yes. Hello.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
-- talking to you...
Would you like some coffee?
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
I hope we will, too.
Meet again, sometime.
Good-bye.
I don't know.
No.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Do you know where you're going?
How can you be sure?
How old?
The oldest living things?
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
I don't like them.
Knowing I have to die...
Only silence. It's always like this.
No birds live here.
Would you like a drink of water?
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Where are you now?
Where?
Have you been here before?
When?
Long ago...
No!... No!
No, don't ask me!
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
No!
No, I can't tell you!
No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
Home?
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
What do you remember?
Would you know the room?
What else?
Where?
How do you know?
There's a name on the gravestone.
What else?
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
No!
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
I'm here, I've got you...
Don't leave me... stay with me...
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
I had the dream. The dream came back again...
Only this far.
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
Yes?! But --
You've been there before. You've seen it.
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
Here with you.
Yes.
My love... because I love you.
No... we're together...
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Why?
Where?
Madeleine --
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
Let me go! Let me go!!
You believe that I love you?
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Let me go into the church alone.
Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
What for? Who are you?
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
Do you live here in the hotel?
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
Just let me talk to you.
You.
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
Your name. And --
Who you are --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
But you haven't lived here long.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
Why?
No, you don't owe me anything.
Dinner... and what else?
Because I remind you of her?
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Mmm.
Thank you again. Good-night.
Tomorrow night? Well --
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
No? Then what?
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
That's not very complimentary, either.
Why?!
Will you, Judy?
I like that one.
Yes --
Honest?
But Scottie, you don't have to!
But I like that one, Scottie.
Scottie, what are you doing?
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
But why?
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
Judy --
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
We'll take it! Will it fit?
You can.
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Ah, no!
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
Where shall we go for dinner?
Ernie's?
Well, after all, it's "our place."
Is that the best you can do?
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
Too late. I've got my face on.
No, Ernie's is fine.
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
All in good time.
How does it work?
Oh, yeah. There.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
Where are you going?
Scottie, why are we here?
But why? Why here?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
Why?
I'm scared.
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
-- and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you."  But I did.
Take me away...
No!
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
We're going up the tower.
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
Yes!
Your accident...
I don't know... Switzerland?
I made it.
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
Some money.
What are you going to do?
I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
Hello.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
She... went into the Bay.
Did she hurt herself?
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
Interesting business.
You don't have to do it for a living.
How long have you been back?
And you like it.
Like all this.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Would you like a drink now?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
Someone dead.
No.
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
I didn't mean to be that rough.
No.
How often does this happen?
Where'd she go?
Well?
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
It's not my line.
How can I see her, to know her?
Ernie's.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
Yes.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
And when she goes to those places...
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Why did she never tell her daughter?
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
So far you're great.  You got a cigarette?
Should I?
Yes.
The Big Boy did...?
Huh.
Me, too.
Dr. Towler...
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
...of the procedures...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
What happened in those three...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Huh.  And why is that?
Another, Frank . . . ?
I want to buy you a drink.
Well, well, well.  Huh?
It's a long road that has no turning.
Hi.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Four.  You're great with these kids.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Mrs...
Yes.
That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
Yes...
Yes.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
What did she say?
One hour.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
A single hour.
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
She told me.
I just saw her.
What?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
It's locked?
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
... You saw her?
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
I'm going to see you get that chance.
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
Hi, Mickey ...
Uh ...
... now who is that ...?
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
I have to talk to you.
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
Are you out of your mind...?
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
What?
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Admittance form is wrong.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport...
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
Been a long time, huh...?
Mary Rooney.  She won't talk to me.  I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
Today is Tuesday.  What?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
What happened, Joey...?
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
I'm swell.
Yeah.
You use their witness.
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
Yeah.  I'm awake.
The Doctors.
Read me what she said.
...one of the other nurses?
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Uh...the admitting nurse...
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
How old are you, how many children ... when did you last eat ...
The broad has disappeared...
...yeah...good...
...four years ago...
I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette...
We got to talk.
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
I don't know.
Dr. Gruber.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Where is he?
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
D'you find an apartment?
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
Why?
What Hotel are you staying at?
I'm a lawyer.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
I think I will.
And are they going to get it?
Maybe what?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
Is this a bad time.
What happened...?
...and is that serious?
Do you want me to go...?
Why don't you get some rest?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
Yes.
Isn't there something you...
You're talking like a drunk.
And it's over...?
Well, then what are you doing here?
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What would you like it to be to me...?  I, I, I can't invest in failure.
Stop pressuring me...
No...no...
Is it over?
What are you going to do?
Thank you.
Continental Casualty...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I can't guarantee that...
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
This is Miss Costello...?
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
I was held up.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
My client can't walk, your Honor.
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
What is it?
That's perfectly all right.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
That happens.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Ready, your Honor.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.
Listen to me, fella...
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Are you done?
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy.  We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end.  Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
Mr. Concannon...?
Overruled...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
You know what happened.
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
And ask me what?
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Dr. Gruber ...
I appreciate--a man as busy as--
I read the hospital report on your client.
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Right.  Who called?
... and you're going to do that?
You're going to settle out of court?
Why?
Her doctors killed her.
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
