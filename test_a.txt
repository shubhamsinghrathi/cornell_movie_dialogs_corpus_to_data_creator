Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
Yes.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
But will they make good use of them?
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Yes?
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
I'm explaining my reasons.
And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
Food!
Food!!
Drink!
Foooooood!
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
There must have been someone else down here then.
His schwanzstucker.
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
I'm getting tired.
Look how far we've come.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
How do you know they're done?
How long is it so far?
Three minutes to go!
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?

Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Another fifteen seconds to go.
How nice.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
Well...
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Inga!
Inga, wake up!
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
I don't know.  It just woke me up.
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
What a filthy mess.
Well, this explains the music.
Oh, doctor!
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
Yes!
Right here?
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
I thought it was wonderful.
It wasn't me.
Oh, Doctor!
Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
What do you think we should do?
I think I'll...carry him.
Me?  Sing?
I'd be so nervous.
It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
Stop -- singing!!!
Are you serious??
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
I think so.
Good night, Doctor.
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Just passing through the night.
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
What?
Nor to Elizabeth.
We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, I have mine.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
MMmmm.
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
MMMMmmmmm!
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
May I see your violin?
Oh, just a little.
Ja, ja.
It's alive!
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
MMMmmmmmmmm.
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
Get the sedative ready!
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Soo -- pah doo -- per.
...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
Fron kon steen!
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
No, Fred ereck.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
You must be Igor.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
I'm sure we will.
How do you do?
Yes, just the two.
What hump?
I beg your pardon?
Why are you talking like that?
No.
What wockers?
Wockers with the knockers???
Home!
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Aye-gor!
What are you doing here?
But what you were doing?
Did you hear that strange music?
Did you hear that strange music??
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
Must be the music room.
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Taking the book along?
What a filthy job!
How?
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
Do you have the name I wrote down?
I want that brain.
Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
Why?
If you like -- just hurry!
You're sure you know what you're doing?
Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.
All right... elevate me!
Tonight?
You've got it, master.
This guy means business.
What?
What?
Wait till he sees the bill.
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
Who are you talking to?
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
It wasn't me.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
Don't fall for that one.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
You can say that again.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
No, no!  That whole thing!
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
Yes, Master!
How's it going?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
How do you know it was a 'he'?
How do you know it was a 'she'?
Can you play it?
Thanks...for all your help.
I'm a failure.
What monster?
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
He's carrying her off now through the woods.
That sound good, boss.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
I'll bet it's a doozy.
Is everything ready?
It's the only way.
I beg your pardon?
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
Vermicelli.
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Nineteen, sir.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
But, sir...
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
Fron kon steen!
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
A week.  Ten days at most.
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
What?
I didn't do that.
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
One week at the most!?
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
You mean... the laboratory??
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
There seem to be quite a few books.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
Well... we'll see.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Good.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Of course.
Yes.
Yes, don't worry.
Yes.
I promise.
Oh, darling -- so will I.
Very....very!
Oh, nice.
Whatever makes you happy.
You're incorrigible!
You bet your boots it does.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling!
Darling!
Surprised!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
What a strange fellow.
Why does he call you 'master'?
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
I suppose you're right.
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Is it worth taking a chance?
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
That's my good boy.
Hello...?
Well... yes.
I...
Baack!
Baack!
MMMmmmm.
MMMmm!
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Still happy you married me?
Love me oodles and oodles?
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
I did, sir.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
From your office, sir.
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Give him an extra dollar.
Yes, sir.
Carlson!
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
... No!
You have the wrong house.
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
No!
Victor Frankenstein.
Ugly, vicious rumous.
Poppycock!
Now wait a minute!
Yes, my dear, he is.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
What do you want with him?
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
The way what is going to be?
What do you mean to do?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
I know.
It does indeed, Max.
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
How?
Is that what you're looking for?
Is it enough?
I'll find him.
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
What did she do to me?
I felt like she almost killed me.
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
Deal.
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
Where are we going?
How?
You designed this yourself?
He helped you?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
Don't you knock?
Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
What do you want?
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
The intention of registration act -
What is it you intend to do to me?
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
Dr. Grey.
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
What if I like the pain?
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
By reading my thoughts?
What if they're naughty?
He's busy right now.
Were you now?
Not interested.
Suit yourself.
He takes his work seriously.
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
I've seen a lot of rings.
I wanted to talk to you.
I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
You know, you --
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
I don't like him being here.
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
What's wrong with him?
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
Are you all right?
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
I'll tell you one thing though.
He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
Into the Hudson?
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here.
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
Its core?
For what purpose?
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
... until he found tungsten.
We all do.
Beast.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
Very nice. I'm impressed.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
What's this?
What's going on, my friend?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
Been to any good diners lately?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
He's a pretty good actor, though.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
Here we go again.
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
Is this what you're looking for?
What's the deal?
Why you dogging me up?
I'm through, Xander.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
What...?
You're serious?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
That's would be me.
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
This is your standard dart gun.
I think I'll hang on to these.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
You're joking, right?
I thought that was in detail.
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
The Peace conference...
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
You do everything Yorgi says?
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
Who are you?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
Hey, you're good.
That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
I'm from L.A.
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
What are you talking about?
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
We'll have to go after them.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
You don't have to do that.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
Yorgi and Kirill.
Did you do your homework?
Let's do this.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
Go to the water, it's that way!
Let me.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
He's shut out the communication circuit!
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
What are you doing?
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
Naturally.
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
"Anarchy" 99"?
What weapons do you have?
What do you get if you finish?
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
He gets to be the hero.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
The scum of the Earth.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
That's exactly why we need them.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
Looks like a diner.
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Why is that?
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Not bad for a gimp.
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
Yeah, I spy or I die.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
We're not after car thieves here.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
Who says you're the good guys?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
Ever see one of these before?
What is that ungodly smell?
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
Laurie!  Good to see you.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
Please.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
Maybe I'll do that.
Their real names, please.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
I'm terribly sorry.
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
No comment.
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
With lots of ketchup?
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
We should get back --  What?
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
Janey, will you marry me?
-- What?
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
What do you mean, frame-up?
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
I don't think she's coming with us.
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
Coward.  Giving up.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
What happened?
What caused it?
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
Adrian.  It�s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Damn straight.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
Maybe not, but why take chances?
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
You're sure?
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
His . . . whatever.
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
Play one.  Educate yourself.
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
You and me.
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
What are you up to?
This'd better not be what I think it is.
What the hell -- ?
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
The costumes.  Am I right?
Yes you are.
That's because --
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
. . . What??
I think he's going to the john.
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Welcome back, Night Owl.
What was he doing?
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Everything's changed --
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
Who?
She's with me.
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
The missing scientists.
What??
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
What is it?  How does it work?
Adrian -- you've lost it.
Don�t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won�t even be here, will we?
I�m not.
Then I�ve been a very bad boy and you�ll have to spank me.  Christ!  I�m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Would you like me to stay?
I could stay and go.
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
Cured, yes.
Jon -- what??
Jon, where are we?
Jon --
Jon -- for God�s sake, what do you see?
Hello, Adrian.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Don't call me that.
Wrong answers?
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
Who is she?  Do you know her?
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
God isn't there to do it.
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Washington?
What about our end?
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
Please.
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
The parcel�s in the post.
Where it can do the most damage.
Still no contact yet.
Is it?
How would you know?
Of course...
What do you think?
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Yes.  Au revoir...
Could...could you come?
Please.
Your father...
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if they�re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
Bond!
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
What class sub does your nephew run?
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Bond, I�m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family�s, now it�s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
Have some of the rat�s nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
She�s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Really Bond, couldn�t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
I thought you were the one in her business.
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
You are out of your league.  She�s working with Renard.
A rope!
Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
No!  Get me out!
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
Where?
Mother of God.
The Maiden�s Tower.
I�d heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
Yes.
Funerals aren�t exactly memorable.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
Who is he?
How long has he been with you?
Does this look familiar to you?
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
If you�ve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I don�t need a third...
That�s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That�s why you�re here, isn�t it? You think I can�t do it. You think I�m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
No.
We�re alright.
You�re not going to.
It�s the only way out...
I know.
I think you�re one of the bravest people I�ve ever met.
...you should rest.
I have to go.
No. You�ll be safe here.
I have to go to work.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
Someone wants to kill me, I�d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
You had your chance, James. Now I�m looking for a bigger thrill.
Really?
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
Shush.
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  I�ve never told anyone that.
A little. Does it matter? After all, what�s the point of living if you can�t feel alive?  Isn�t that right, Elektra? Isn�t that your motto?
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
You can drop the act, it�s over.
I think you do.
He used your exact words.
I�m coming with you.
I could have given you the world.
Where�s M?
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Since I was a child, I�ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn�t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
Just like you...only you were even easier.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
It is my oil!  Mine and my family�s!
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
Elektra, it�s not too late.  Eight million people needn�t die.
Oh James.
Yes.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
You knew him well?
I�m sorry.
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
Revenge isn�t so hard to fathom. What�s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Who is it?
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
Consider me ungrateful.
She�ll get over it.
In case you�ve forgotten.  I�m dead already.
Which is neutral, no doubt.
Who did you get it from?
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
The name?
Construction�s not exactly my line.
Old friend?
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
She�s not a girl anymore.
It�s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
And now it�s up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.
I took the initiative.
I was the one who brought that money in...
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
Who?
Renard.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
He survived?
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn�t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
The report King bought. It�s a manual. Renard�s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
They�re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can�t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
Is maybe...the inside woman.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
James.  It wouldn�t really be...
Perhaps after this ... test?
I could come for a second opinion?
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Don�t know any doctor jokes.
Couldn�t make it. Splitting headache.
He is an impostor.  There�s no Davidov at Miratom.
Shame you had to spot I wasn�t the real thing.
Bond --
With this?
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
The plutonium is missing.  They�ve taken the core!
It�s a bomb alright. We�re still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
I did kill us. She thinks we�re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
It�s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Elektra King.
Makes her look even more innocent.
I was hoping you could tell me.
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And M�s life is part of the bet.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He�s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub�s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
The King pipeline.
Zukovsky...
Is there another way?
He�s sealed himself in.
Do you know what you�re doing?
What kind of bikes did you ride?
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or we�ll sink.
Count to twenty.  I�ll be there.
We can�t.
So isn�t it time you unwrapped your present?
But I still want one.
Stop that dog!
Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
Help!
It makes you nervous?
What about us?
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Well --
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
How can I ever thank you enough?
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
No, sir!
We do.
To Oz!
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
A heart --
Hurry -- hurry --
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Hey, Dorothy!
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Let's.
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you!  Help!
Ho -- ho --ho
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
Oh - look out.
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
It's a whozis.
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Oh, dear, dear.
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
...to Dorothy!
Come on, fellows!
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Oh, no!
You put up a great fight, Lion.
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Go on!
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Ohhhh -- it's me!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
Ohhhhhh!
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
... about Dorothy.
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
No, her dog!
NO!
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
I haven't slept in weeks.
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Imposserous!
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
Hold still - hold still --
It's a whatzis?
Whozat?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
No?  Now, wait a minute.
Where do we go now?
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
You don't get around us that easy!
Don't you start it, too!
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Who at?
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
What happened?
Oh, you did it yourself!
Here --   Come on.
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
I've got a plan how to get in there.
And you're going to lead us.
Yes, you.
That's right.
Up!
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Stop pushing!
Where -- where do we go now?
You humbug!
Real courage. That's what we want.
Yeah.
Dorothy next!
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Leave her alone!
...ting the ruby slippers?
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
...yes.
Ohh!
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Ohhh --
...free!
Did I scare you?
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
Um-hmm.
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Um-hmm.
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
I don't blame you for that.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
To Oz!
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Oh --
What?
Oil can what?
He said his mouth.
The other side....
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Oh --
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Oh -- Oh --
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
No -- No -- No -- No!
Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
I have so got brains.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
...has been simply unbearable.
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
The nerve.
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
Yes.
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
Hah!
It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
Not nobody, not nohow!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
But why?  Why?
Oh, come on.
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Does it work?
Oh --
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Ohhh!
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Did you say something?
Where do you want to be oiled first?
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
Oh --
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
Well, you're perfect now.
Oh --!
All hollow.  Oh --
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh --
Oh-oh-
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
Oh --
What sort of an animal is that?
And him a brain.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh, he's just ascared again.
No.  Why only --  Oh --
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Dorothy!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
...yes.
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
No --
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Stop her!
How did you guess?
Why --
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
No, they won't - honestly.
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
That's our farm!
...her face is careworn.
Her -- her name is Emily.
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
What's she doing now?
Has it poppies on the wall....
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
Oh, no -- no!
Oh, you....
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Oh -- 
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Toto's my dog.
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
I have?
Toto, too.
Whenever you wish.
Are you ready now?
Yes, I'm ready now.
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Run, Toto, run!
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
This?
Oh!
Hickory!
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
I don't believe you!
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Goodbye, folks!
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
...resourceful!
Not so fast!  Not....
Do you presume to criticize the....
Who are you?
You are?
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
If she...
Is morally, ethic'ly
If any!
From now on you'll be history
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Uhh -- yeah --
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
No --
Dorothy!
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
No --
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
No... No. It is just the English way.
They are English. They don't understand.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
He'll live.
Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
My son is out there!
I don't think she knows.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
He's not in this building.
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
His name is John Book.
No...
That has no place in this house.
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws �
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
You are acting like one!
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
No, Rachel...
Yes, thank you very much.
Yes.
Good morning.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
Did you find him?
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him �
But... if you had to guess?
Wrong.
Probably.
I admit I don't know where he is.
He's got my number.
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
I didn't even know about it.
I got there late, John.
It won't happen again.
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
Johnny, what the fuck?
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch � I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Make that 1790.
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
Where are you taking us?
You have no right to keep us here.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
It's not a joke.
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
We do not go into your courts.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
They kid a lot.
But not a good tired.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
Because � somehow � they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
Home.
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
No, no doctor...
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Who are they?
Can I have something to drink?
Only the elders.
What?
Two days.
But you can't.
You tell him. When you're able.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
Enjoying your reading?
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Something wrong with buttons?
Hochmut?
Anything against zippers?
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
But Stoltzfus said...
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
Oh. The bullets.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
A real fireball.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
Sure.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
Not long... A few days.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
There was.
I know.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
Aren't you? After today?
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
That's your way, not mine.
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
Where's my baggy pants?
Oh, he's good.
Yeah.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight � street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
Maybe.
Maybe.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde � what's-her-name � come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Who else knows?
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Just us.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
Johnny �
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in �
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
It's all over, Paul.
Who'd you see?
No... I saw the man who killed him.
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
No pistol. Ever.
Okay, Mr. Book.
You don't say.
...I want to say a thing.
Is it them?
Are they going to kill you?
What are you going to do?
Don't let them hurt you.
Are you really ever coming back?
Have you got your gun on now?
I thought I was the English.
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter.
Pretty much.
Yes, sir.
Pick up the hat.
Sorry. It's important.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Just do it!
Maybe milking.
Cows. You know, cows?
Good, you start tomorrow.
Not one this big.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Queen Cherlindrea?
Who??
I'm getting her out of there!
Ohhh, I hate this.
Why not?
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
How are we going to get out there?
The sorceress.
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
Shut up.
I changed her already!
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Who is he?
She's hungry.
Here.  Hold her.
Somebody has to do it.
He never misses.
Me neither!
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Ouch!  Let go of me!
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
No!
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
That's all I ever wanted!
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
Burn it to a fine ash.
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
The limitless power of...
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
But what am I gonna transform??
Oooh, this smells terrible.
Ouch!!
What'd you bit me for!!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
Now use it.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
There's nobody here.
Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
More!  More!
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
Why?
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
She's too powerful, Raziel
Surrender!!
Courage, Willow.
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
Absolutely not.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Don't make me angry, Peck.
Miserable Pecks.
Why.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Thanks for your help, Peck.
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
You a woodcutter?
Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Are you a warrior?
What's that?  I hear something!
What is it?
Friend of yours?
I hate this.
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
I will.
Absolutely!
Of course!  I promise!
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
Where the hell did you come from?
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Time to change her diaper.
Because she's sick.
Where's the baby??
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
I did?
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
Madmartigan, I need your help.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
I won't.
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Who?
She said lots of thing.s
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
She's in love.
You?
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Ahhh!
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
I don't know, Willow.
He's no magician.
Then you get us out of here.
Who is that girl, anyway?
We're a tiny version of all that?
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
No.  I mean yes.
Let me see it.
Why not?
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
I do what I'm told.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Why did you say that?
I love you.
I don't believe you.
Madmartigan.
I have no family.
Not today, Willow.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Willow Ufgood.
I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
Me?
What is Tir Asleen?
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
You left me to die, friend.
Is this what's left of your army?
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
Then come with us.
Just get me some horses.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Let's go.
They're coming.
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
Hey...!
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Dr. Pemberton?
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
We'll explain on the way.
Who was this partner of his?
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
It's a smelting retort.
It is?
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
No, sir... just a businessman.
I deal with some tough customers.
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Dr. Loveless?
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
He had a pressing engagement.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
That would be... the Mexican War?
I've even printed my own currency.
The first.
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
Easy now.
That'll be all, boys.
This is Colonel Richards.
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
And?
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Yes sir.
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Your private train, sir.
That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
My friend?
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
Really?
My... the wild west.
Your guests, ma'am?
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
You most certainly do.
I don't like to lose, either.
You tell me.
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
Would that include me?
You've... done... this... before.
She's perfectly safe.
My.  It's gotten longer.
I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
Fine, I'll stop.
We'll see.
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
Yes, me!
You didn't tell us you had this on!
He calls it the Tarantula.
He's not giving up?
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
Jim West.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Funny.  So am I.
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
But don't pull that again.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
"Ay, there's the rub."  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
Always hoping.  Or this...
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Try what?
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
I'll work on it.
Aha?
Is this leading somewhere?
Starting with a screw?
What about the explosive?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
My disguise.  And here...
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
That's a lot of butler.
Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
Almost?
You feeling all right?
Now, what was that?
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
All what?
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
I'm going to hit you.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Hey, I tried the board.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
Jim, are you all right?
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
What way is that?
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Know what this is?
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
It's better than nothing.
He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
Willard...
It's a town!
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
Relax.  We're almost there.
What is that?
And people are actually fooled by that?
Not again.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
When we find him, he is mine.
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
My pleasure.
What?  President Grant is...!
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
Of course not.
Thank you.
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
Where have you been?
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
In the next two minutes?
What is this?  A whole new train?
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
Hi, Sandy.
Can't.  Got a passenger.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Sandy... What's up?
No.
Didn't you see her this morning?
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
Sam...
But I..
Yeah, right.
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
That was the same thing Ray said.
Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
Story's the same, Detective...
The one you bought at school.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
And she wanted to talk.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
But she ran away.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...
Sit down, Lombardo.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Jesus, man... You okay?
Come off it, man... It was an accident.
I did.  At Blue Balls.
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
Will they?
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
You got something against cigarettes?
That's cop bullshit.
About what?
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Get away from me.
Shut up.
That's right.  That was his name.
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
That's right.
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
You can't...
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared.  And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
Just like that?
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
I won't.
No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
In back of the garage.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
How much?
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
We have to stick with the plan.
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
Hello.
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
I don't know.  I want to see you...
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
Okay.  I love you too.
That's not your line.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
I'm running away.
Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
Hi, Mon.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Okay, what's the matter?
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
No thanks to you.
I miss Dad.
No you don't.
What?
He... Sam Lombardo?
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
A friend of mine bought a boat.
Curiosity, I guess.
Excuse me?
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
Police -- God -- get a life.
I'm not on your property!
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
You are.
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
What are you looking at?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
I wanna live at the beach someday.
It's those rocks, up there.
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
I say something funny?
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
No!
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
What?
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
Yeah... okay... he did
I wanna go home now.
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
Ms. Toller?
Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
I'm sorry?
Your Honor... Please...
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
What about witnesses?
And what do they say?
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
Just tell us what happened.
She bit you?
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
Where's this coming from?
I want a full-scale investigation.
I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
About a year ago.
Yeah.
No.
Yes.
I guess.
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
What was that?
Back to the land of grownups.
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
You're telling me you believe the guy?
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
You saw the news today?
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
Eliminate the competition.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
Guess I kind of lost it there.
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
You have someplace to be?
Just check out the car.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
We don't know that, Ray...
Ray, you heard him...
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
Where's Lombardo?
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
I'd like that.
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
No.
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
Suzie Toller is missing.
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
You could tell me where you were last night.
Suzie?
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
Did you try to fight him?
Then what?
You mean he withdrew...
Try, Kelly.
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
What about the blood?
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
Eat a power bar.
Kelly.
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
Thanks.
And where might that be?
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Kelly Van Ryan...
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
I... You know... I...
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
People pay good money for that?
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
My parents? What do you mean?
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
How quaint.
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire.  You own it now. Any questions?
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
You do like girls, don't you?
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
You're sure?
Seldom? No kidding?
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
Tipping?
Yeah.  Everything's cool.
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
I do?
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
Why, look who's here.
I was like a different person tonight.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
Really? You'd do that for me?
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
What kind of ideas?
You think we should be more open minded?
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
That's perfect.
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
He was in a league of his own.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
Yes?
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
What are you doing?
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
I'm warning you.
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
You called the cops on us?
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
That's part of growing up, honey.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
You promise you'll finish school?
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
Forget the store. Think big.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning expos� changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
Me-ow.
I have absolutely no intention--
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
Your article sucked.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
I'm trying to help.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
Then I'll write about YOU.
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
I don't get the distinction.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
I guess.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Don't write that part.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Funny you should say "peachy."
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
A little respect would be nice, that's all.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Wow...you clean up nice.
Where are we going?
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
Whatever.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
I see.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
I mean my father.
It's all so complicated.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
And then what?
You're amazing.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
Well? Where the hell are you?
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
What about you?
Tell me more.
I see.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Do you trust me, Julie?
Come on.
I want you to trust me.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
But absolutely true.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
You're quick. I like that.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know.
Very ambitious. I like that.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
Yellow pages?
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
My new bike.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
If you could just sign right there.
Just a formality.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
I meant biologically.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
I didn't forget.
Great.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
You mean they knew who I was?
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
My legacy.
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
Everything.
They're in the ignition, silly.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
That's me.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Who exactly ARE you?
And who IS Ted Nelson?
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Teddy? I was thinking.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
Ted! Do something!
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Well?
It's my private business! Mine!
Dad, please.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
You guys are my parents.
They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
Well, why should I?
I guess.
Yeah.
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
...not the pit.
Just say it, Dad.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
Finally, some gratitude.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
Sorry I--
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
You ordered a Winnebago?
Watch your tone, mister.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
We own a small family grocery store.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
We love our lives just the way they are.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
We miss our family.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
From your lips, to God's ears.
Ladies first.  I insist.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
Ted, have you lost your mind?
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
Yeah? You like?
Hi, Teddy Bear.
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Do it?
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
That was code for "I like you."
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Well?
I mean, what do you think?
Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
God, you are so hot.
We reinvented ourselves.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
Let me get this straight...
These are real, live women?
God, I love being dead.
You and your pep talks.
That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
Were you always this sick?
Someday, I'll find out.
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
I defy any and all limits.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
Who the hell was your father?
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
So far away? In Xenia?
Check this out.  Hurry!
Hurry.
Check it out!
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
Dead?
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
Take a whiff of heaven.
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
You're late, bro!
You'll never believe who's in there.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
I thought I loved her.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Get them together.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
Yes...?
Dead?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
Sugar?
ANGEL...
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Just put it in my room
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
Her husband left her
I thought it was you - how are you?
Yes, come on in...
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
What's this all about?
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
At home alone - where were you?
Get out...
I think you had better leave
At 2.00...
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
You heard me - keep away from him
Yes I can...
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
What happened?
Is LESLIE here?
He saved my life you know - has he told you...
I really don't know what to say
Sure...
I lost the touch
Do you take sugar?
What are you doing?
What's with all the locks - and hammering
My names isn't ANGELA...
Don't worry - Is that my hammer  Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage...
I think I will pass...
Yes, one and a half please.
I'm a dentist
Oh, about six years since I graduated
I don't know
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
I don't know
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
What did you do with her?
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
How long have you been watching me?
Tell me about your wife...
then why did you marry her -
What didn't you like about her?
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
You've killed but you're not a killer
Tell me how it happened...
Why not? Please - it would help me
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
Did you?
STEPHANIE?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
What?
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
What is it?
Yes...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
Where are you going?
We've got nothing to talk about
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
First finish your tea...
Why did you let him in?
I don't like sugar
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
WAIT FOR WHAT!?
You killed my friend!
It's what you would do to me
No - I'll have you after
CHIC MAGAZINE?
When could I look round?
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
Yes it is...
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
That's right...
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
No - not all the time - I mean
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
This must be one of the old keys -
The one on the left - definitely...
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
I heard something like that
OH MY GAWD!
A person could get killed round here just for working late
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
Papers...?
I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
You really love this guy...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
Is that what you were doing...?
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
I just - hate it when they're - finished.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
You can't just -
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
Wow...
You okay...?
I'm getting --- left behind.
Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
Just don't fall off any ladders.
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
I'm glad you're around to say it.
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
The one time I want it to work...
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
Harder...
HARDER!
Yessssss...
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
And whose houses do you design...?
You still feel that crazy...?
Really...?  Your family there...?
Too much... too fast...?
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Why don't you let at do that...?
Doctor's orders- - -?
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
God knows, I'm intriguing.

We're quite a pair, you and I.
Hello...?
Rowan...?
What's wrong..?
What about you coming down here...?
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
You know...?
She - she said I - I was a ---
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
I am!   And so are you.  You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  Michael, if you don't want -
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
What about your work back home...?
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
You sure...?
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
And I thought I was the mindreader.
That's GREAT!
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
A little wine...?
Dropped it.
Mm-hmmm...
Mm-hmm...
Mm-hmm...
Did you see the old man on the ---
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
You did that, didn't you...?
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
I'm serious.    Whatever it was - it's still there inside me, isn't it - change and all...?
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
Lock the door.  Lock it
I don't know.
A bit much.    Lucas.
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
What were you talking about...?
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
Something's wrong with you.
Hi.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
I can't.
I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Stop it!
You bastard!
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
Rowan...
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
I know.    you are my son -
Lie...?
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
STOP!
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
You bastard...
It is from love.
If you knew how I yearn for that...
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
You're very clever, aren't you...?
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
There is no one here but the dead.
If that were true, I would not be here.
From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child...
It's too soon to know.
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
I LOVE him!
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
But have I...?  Ever...?!
I love Michael...
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
Only you...
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
What is wrong...?
I do not understand...
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am.
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
Anybody got a BP yet...?
FAST.
He just went out like & light-
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Michael...  Do what you can.
Lasher - bring us through!
Hello...?  Who is this...?
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
I beg your par---
Who is this...?
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
My...mother...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
Who the hel1 -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
I'm coming down there!!  And it you put my mother in the ground betore I arrive, you'll wish you'd never seen my face!  IS THAT UNDERSTOOD...?!
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
There are things I have to know!
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
And this - if you decide to take the rest.
The lamplight.  That's all.
Better than most, I suppose.
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
You're a monster.
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
I want to see my mother.
He made that quite clear, yes.
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
I don't want it.
Then you wear it.
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
A what...?
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
Rowan.
Don't tell Rowan about this.
NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
Every day  twice.
What are you talk---
Rowan...
Then what is he...?
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
But you've not told Michael.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
Two what...?
With his hands!
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
:Well, they are.
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
I think three...
What's their name?
She's awake.
When's she out of here?
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
It's today?
Claire?
Whatcha reading?
How is it?
Nice.  Almost done.
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
Fine.
I am, really.
Not the focus.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
We did.
I know.
Nope.
Yup.
Shhh.
Mmm.
Tomorrow.
After that.
Of what?
Did she say that?
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
Remember how we were?
Why?
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
Claire...
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
It's what I've been working for.
Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
Norman, you have to look at this!
Hurry...
Is it gone?
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
Unless you need me to come home...
Claire?
What are you doing here?
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
Did you call the police?
Of course.
What kind of whispering?
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
Think I may have cracked it.
I think so.  Maybe.
Yep.
You know what that does to me.
You're kidding.
Wow.
Well, that's nice.
Oh, no...
That's...
I'm so sorry.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
What?  No.  No.
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
Did you call about the Feurs?
Huh.
What's going on, Claire?
He killed her.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
No.  Look!  In the window.
A flare?
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
Where is she then?
Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this.
What am I looking at?
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
...Don't get all...
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
You're not at the center.
We're going to be fine.
Well, that's a relief.
Harvey says he's amazing.
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
We had a seance.
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
But then you've been so much better...
Sweetheart--
Keep your voice down.
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
I'm sorry...
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
Really big bed.
Yep.
What?
You know I am.
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
We walked all night...
You don't remember?
You dropped a glass.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
I may have seen her on campus.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
The...
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
...I'm positive this time...
It's Madison Fra--
I take it your not mad at me.
Ow!
It's too rough.
I don't like this, this...
I think she's starting to suspect something.
Your wife...
"You know..."
I was there.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
So you fucked a student?!
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
Who?
Leave her out of this!
Stop...
I'm not going to listen to this.
You should have tried harder.
Get out of my way.
How did she know where it was?
We don't know that for sure.
We have to get out of here.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
What?
How can you be sure?
Claire...
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
What?
Huh.
Don't think so.
What's that for?
I'm cooking you dinner.
I know.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
I don't believe you.
Mmmuh...
Mauduh...
MADISON!
Good.  I'm good.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
What is it?
Jody--
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Oh my god.  You bought it.
It's niiice.
Absolutely.
You got it.
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
What?
Jody, no...
...no...no...no...
Please.  That's all I need.
What?
I don't...
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
The planchette?
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
Nothing's happening.
Oh...
Mef?  What's Mef?
I have to go.
Are you okay?
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
Jody, she's alive.
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Did I?
Hartford?
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Please.
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
I was down in Adamant...
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
Why?
Relieved?
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
All of us.
No.
What are you going to do?
If she was dangerous before--
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I can't believe this is happening.
That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
Like what?
What is it?
Did he say that?
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
I don't know...
This is...
He looked like one of the Monkees.
I didn't sleep with him.
He was so pissed.
We were suite mates.
Oh God...
Stop.
Do we have to?
She's making this up.
She got it.  Turned it down.
Mrs. Frank?
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
No, I don't.
What's your name?
She never mentioned you.
It's fine.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
She never mentioned her father.
Why are you here?
It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
You must have been very proud.
I should be going anyway.
Of course.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
Um...yes.
Is everything alright?
I'm not...
Who?  Your husband?
What?  What are you afraid of?
Tell me.  Please.
Tell me.  I can help you.
That's not...It's not like that.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
Wait!  Don't go...
You do?
And then you weren't there.
Would you like some iced tea?
Your house is so beautiful.
And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
Love.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
No.  No, I don't.
Um...
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
Well maybe your wife...
When...when will she be back?
Oh-kay...
Who?
I didn't kill my wife.
I am.
How're you holding up?
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
Wonderful.  It's good to see you two doing so well.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
At the party.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Who's that?
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Then why did you?
Your husband?
Do you really think so?
Why is he worried?
Fireball?
These are good.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
What do you think I should do?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
Nope.
I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
Well, that's what we're here for.
Yes, but...
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
Do you?
What do you think?  Guess.
Have you been hurt?
You were in an accident?
What?
That can't feel good.
Hey.
It's only two hours away.
I'll come back all the time.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
I know he does.
Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
So much.
What do you mean?
A ghost?
No.  But once I heard...
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
You guys are being real assholes
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
Mom.
They're all human beings
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
No thank you sir we're fine.
Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them
Well divide 18 into three
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
Maybe before the event, never after.
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
Safety in numbers man.
Anyone else not coming?
This time I really don't see anyone man.
This. is killer.
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
What?  Tony and China, together?
I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
No Mark. MARK Why not?
Come on.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
Oh that explains everything.
Big deal!
Who's is all this?
Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
China
Go away.
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
They seemed, closing by much 
Vell.  Goodnight.
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
No?
A party at a waxwork huh?
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Thank you Jenkins
Thank you
Thank you
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Have a nice day  sir
Jenkins!
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
Hi
Hmm.
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
It's eleven forty-five let's go
About what?  About us.
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Suffer?  We're living in America.
Ok toots, I will.
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
With Mark?
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Businessman!
Yeah, yeah, OK
So why are you dating Jonathan?
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.
We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
You got it, G.G.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
You told him about us?
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
I can't...and I won't.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy. 
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
Any better and I'd be guilty.
...how do you know? You wish...
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
Oh Christ!
Excuse me.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Where is it?
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
What if I have a previous engagement?
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
So. See you Friday.
Only if I want something bad enough.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
I don't.
...isn't it perfect!
You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker.
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.
Get the hell out!
Why?
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
Oh no, no...
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
Jackson, Steinem...
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
How do you know?
My home number's on the back...
Hi sport.
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...
...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
Know the name?
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
I guess I'll head back...
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
You're learning, sport...
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
...Gordon.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
What does that mean?
What makes you think you can?
Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
How much is enough Gordon?
Obviously...
...I can't make it tonight.
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Hello Bud.
You sandbagged me on Bluestar.  I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
So what's the problem?
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
He never told me...
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
We are?
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
So you're hot on this stock?
Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
What if he asks where I got the money?
What if they call him?
You sure?
I don't know anything!
What are you doing here?
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
Coulda been a contender.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
How's Mom?
...Work okay?
That's great Dad.
Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad...
About what?
Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Alright. Why so pissed?
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes.
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
I met them before you were born.
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
Your words, not mine...
Another cup of coffee?
I guess it's time to hit the road.
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
Hey, things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out, rookie.
Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there.
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
All right, I owe you one Marv.
What the hell...
What's going on?
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
Hey the door was open.
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders.
Start unloading.
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
Buddy boy, how ya doing?
Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
...you take that Anacott Steel?
So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch.
Please, no thanks... 
Oh really.
Grand Marnier.
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
What about tipping off Yurovich?
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
No, I think..
No, I think it's ... can we see the calico <u>kitten</u>...?

A beret.
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
With their berets...
I need a ruling on the Hats.  I say a Leopard-skin, and...
What would be true, then.
...as of today, 89% favorable.
...by you?
Well, there's a lot to be said for that.  And I'm going to show a clip.  You've seen it before, you've seen it <u>many</u> times...  But I'm going to ask you to look at it once more.  With the election one day off, and the President's standing in the polls...
I believe in you....
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...

We had Davy Crockett hats, but you could <u>crush</u>'em ... you could <u>crush</u>'em, see, when you felt stupid. Crush'em, put em in your Pocket.  You can't put a Mountie hat in your...
The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
Leopard Skin...
It's a <u>beret</u>...
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
Keep Talking....
...what am I <u>doing</u>?  Do you see me working...?  Here's what you want to do, you want to come out of the box, an item, someone 'ready <u>has</u>, but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  Torn <u>jeans</u>, uh ... faded Levi Jackets, uh... uh...
Headshots.  Girls to play the girl in our footage.  I like the sorrowful one.  Anybody Else....? 
I go with this here... 
Bunny:  I had an idea:  a Slinky, that falls <u>Up</u>...  Naa, we can figure that <u>out</u>.  What I'm wondering:  what do we <u>call</u> it...  You got my number... 
We got the guy, we got the guy, we got the Guy!
It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over.
...what do you got?
All part of the Service we Render.
When do you bring'em back?  Schumann.
See y'at the Finish Line.
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
Take ten.
It's too clean.
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
What do you want the kid to say?
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
What do you think would hold it off?
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Remember the Maine...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking <u>wars</u>.  Y'know why.  Cause it's <u>show business</u>. That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, <u>One Shot</u> of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here.
Why Albania?
Who?
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
"The Country Is At War." 
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
They got to have something that we want.
What do we have that they want?
Why would they want that?
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
...it's a Teaser!
You can't have a war without an enemy.
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
W...what?
"Back End" ... count on it.
King, King, I got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger back-end than Hattie McDaniel. Now:
Three-o-three...
What is it?
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
What?
The War ain't over. 
The war ain't over til I <u>say</u> it's over.  This is <u>my</u> picture.  You think you're in a <u>spot</u>?  You think this is a tight spot?  Try making the Hunchback of Notre Dame when your three lead actors <u>die</u>, two weeks from the end of Principal Photography.  This is... this is... this is just...  Act One:  THE WAR. Act <u>Two</u> ... the... uh...
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
In the Folk Music Section.
...this the Guy.
Where is he now?
...we get our hands on him?
What's the thing with Morse Code...
My prop guy, had a guy out here.
What?
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
Mmm...
Mmm.
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
I've come to feel It's my thing.  You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's <u>just</u> a job.  And then...
...<u>isn't</u> it?  Hey, what-the-hey ... it's all part of the bittersweet...
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Big mistake.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
The Albanian Campaign.
...the Albanian Campaign.  And we won't even be a footnote...
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  <u>Isn't</u> he...
You've <u>got</u> something, there...
...givem what they want...But...
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."
 A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>...
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.
Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?  I'm going to need an <u>ambulance</u>, we take him, the last moment, right from the Pl...no, <u>we</u> land, we puttem <u>in</u> the ambulance.  Air force jet lands, we take somebody <u>else</u> off <u>that</u> jet...what the fuck do <u>I</u> care? Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a ......hello?  Hello...?
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
An anti-psychotic...
Mmm.
...what happened...?
How's our friend?
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't <u>care</u> -- I'm just <u>addicted to it</u>...
Is he dead?
Leav't alone.  Wha'd television ever do to you?  Ate your <u>life</u>, ruin'd your <u>Culture</u>, but...
Get on your feet, boy.
We're going home.  We're going home together...
Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...
Finish Strong!  Are you <u>nuts</u>?  Are you nuts?  This's Pennies from <u>Heaven</u>... on his triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced Down...AND YET...
We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles...
Why not?
Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
...but...
Pals:  Get on the <u>phone</u>... r'they flying it?
Get on the phone, have'em fly in a ...whaddaya need to be a citizen?  A Judge?  Whaddaya need?  A Judge...? Call in a <u>Judge</u>, call in a Federal <u>Judge</u>, and...  If you're concerned about him, being an ..."immigrant." Make him a <u>citizen</u>... Eh?  <u>Guys</u> ... what's all this <u>mopery</u>, we...
...one more day.
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.
Show Must Go On.
Prouder of this, than anything I ever did in my life. I want to thank you, Ron.  Want to thank you.
I'm looking for a phone...
Watch me.
Watch me.
Deal's changed.
<u>Money</u>?  You think I did this for money...?  I did this for <u>Credit</u>.  <u>Credit</u>, paalll...
That's <u>one</u> thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>?  Are you <u>Nuts</u>?
When's he coming back...?
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
...why?
...Yes.
...Good...
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
Who're you working for?
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
I have a question for you.
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.
To preserve their Way of Life.
I have.
Well, c'n we get him back home?
We're due at Andrews. 
Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?
Whaddaya think?
...what is this?
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Hello...?
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
Out in Oklahoma.
...we own it?
ON BREAN, WHO IS DOODLING.
How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"
BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.
..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash....
...how ya feeling, boy?
Shoe, boy...?  You know, you were telling me you wanted Beans?  Remember, you were concerned about the Beans...?
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
But that group has been, in the main, subdued.  Now: How did we come by this information?  And.  Who subdued that group? 
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, Enemy Lines. 
And I can only say, to those family members, <u>of</u> group 303, which members are, I know, as I speak, gathering to comfort you, the parents of the missing man, I can only say,
Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...
...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our...
You gonna git me back tomorrow?  Cause they havin <u>beans</u> tomorrow...
THE GROUP WATCHING TELEVISION.
Where's my pill...?
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
Quite touching.
Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Don't you want to know if it's true?
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
When do we bring'em back?
It won't hold.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
We're going to have to explain away the...
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
What crisis?
<u>Do</u> it...
It won't hold.
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
What would do that...?
I'm working on it.
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
What is it?
Twenty thousand dollars.
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.
Tell, tell, tell me again.
Tell me again.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
...the... 
Yes
...but...
...you want us to go to War...
Why?
...they sound what?
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
<u>Who</u>?
Yes.
What do you know about them?
Precisely.
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
Here's what you got to do:  Get your Press Office, Right now.  To deny;  There <u>is</u> no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A.
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The Hostages...?
In the yellow ribbon.
The Ribbon Manufacturers.
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
...I just hope...

Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.

How long you been up, you need a nap.
<u>Nashville</u>...?
You're tired, Ronnie.

8 days and we bring it back home....
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...

Never quit a winner.

Courage, Mom.

What about him?
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
Stanley, you can't do this....
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?
We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand... No, No wait a second, no, no, wait a second, No.  The Bomb's not... it's not <u>there</u> -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a <u>suitcase</u> Bomb.  Ooookay.  It's a <u>suitcase</u> bomb, and it's .... in Canada!  Eh?  Albanian Terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada, in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA.

A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
Can we have a white one, please...
Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?
What'd ya think?
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
Indeed it is.

Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
Well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...
Oh, Lord....
Come on.
Come on.
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
No, no, no...
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
...the Harvester... 
What are you talking about?
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
<u>Lure</u> him. 
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
For Schumann.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
You and me have nothing in common.
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you��
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
Where did you plant the C-4?!
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
There you go �� best seat in the house.
Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his Re�Election Rally...
I've got some final preparations to take care of�� Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
What are you talking about?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
That's not true, Parker.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
I don't need a baby�sitter.
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.
Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
I know who would know.
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
Do me one favor �� if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
I am impressed.
Who said that?
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son�of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Give me your wrist.
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
How did you get your hand out?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
Don't worry about it, all right?
Relax. I know what you meant.
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
Stop me.
This is my area of expertise.
Nothing.
Enjoying yourself?
This isn't a game, Parker!
What's the problem?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished...
You like baseball?
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Which way?
Parker -� stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you��
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
We know you didn't kill those guards.
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
How did you find out about the toxin?
You're not capable of it.
I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Part of him is.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
See something?
Nice work.
Find out anything?
Can I ask you something?
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go �� right now.  Why are you going to do this?
That's why I'm asking.
You okay?
More or less.
My guess is dead.
I don't know.
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
I couldn't tell you.
Duck!
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was me, what?
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
All my work is my finest.
I think I understand what you have in mind...
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
Of course you are.
Help me get out of here.
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
What's wrong with Parker?
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
Talk so I can understand.
Then fix it.
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
Do I get to see it or not?
Get that fucking thing away from me!
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
Separate the character module from the neural net...
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
You need a maid.
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
I'm still making adjustments...
I'M WHAT?!
I understand... I understand perfectly.
He hears...everything.
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
What the hell happened?
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
Only because I got pulled out early.
Think you can do it?
This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
What did you find out?
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
Enough to level an entire city block.
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
You know how much man power you're talking about?
This better not be a wild goose chase.
Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re�assignment.
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twenty�four citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
In other words, we collectively don't know shit.
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
You think he's smart?
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
I need your help--
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
Got it.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar �� you making it okay in there?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
Do me a favor �� keep sending them.
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
If you can catch him.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Why wasn't I told?
You mean a nano�tech synthetic organism.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
But only you will know he's not human.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
I don't know.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
In English, please.
It was very well�hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
Me? What did I do?
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device �� it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
Hello.
Today, a good girl.
What?
How did you see me?
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
No, I don't want to.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
I have a headache.
What happened to me?
Have I slept long?
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
What about you, Manuel?
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
When you are, miss.
Don't talk like that!
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
What's going on, Moncho?
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
I'm afraid.
A black bull came.
It's a very big one.
Yes -- very, very big!
He came in through the cupboard.
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Why not?
Where?
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
They told me it isn't at the hospital.
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
Things seem to be getting better.
Are your parents alive?
Don't say that.
You'll soon find out, you liar!
He's lying through his ass!
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.
What's he called?
Are you Jorge?
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
What do you know about me?
And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now.
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
Leave him alone.
Do they worry you that much, then?
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Are they going to work here too?
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
Do you intend to stay here for some time?
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
She's left.
No.
Why did he kill himself?
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
Why?
These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
Where's the dough?
Kill him.
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
Nothing.
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
So, Ramona!
If you wake first, wake me up.
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this.
That your cousin is more to your taste.
It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
You see how much you like her?
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Thank you; but it's missing something.
My God, what have you done to him!
But why? Why?
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
Fifteen yards.
That's it.
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
That's good land.
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
What will the lady say?
If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
Yes.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
Yes, sir. Good night.
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
What's the matter?
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
But what can I say to her, sir?
You believe me, don't you?
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
You'll think you're still at the convent.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
No.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Who is she?
Come down.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
Only because you want it.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Don't you ever see him?
How could anybody behave like that?
Evil.
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
Thank you, Uncle.
Whatever you like.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
Wasn't that cowardice?
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Unfortunately ...
Maybe ...
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Don't go!
No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
Go away! Leave me alone.
You must listen to me before you go.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
Then you won't forgive me?
Two.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Don Amalio!
Enedina and Paco ...
They're playing games behind the couch ...
That one.
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
No, the children sleep with me.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
Stop this, stop this.
Where's the camera?
Drum banging real times.
It was an accident!
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
That's right.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
I don't think that's a good idea.
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
Take your time. I wish I had.
So where to on the honeymoon?
That's our plan.
...embarrassing, shameful...
The stone age.
A mutant species.
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
"You Send Me."
You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
I do.
Yup.
How do you know she's dead.
I got to agree with that.
What?
Did she believe you?
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
Greenpeace.
Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...
Downstairs in the closet.
My God...
Did he try to kiss you?
You alright?
I guess.
Pup corn?
There.
Yeah?
That's a good one.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
What does that mean?
About what?
I just want her to be happy.
I'm not breathing right.
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
He's your brother.
I'll take a ride.
Come on.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
At the newsstand on 3rd.
Buzzing?
I don't hear it.
Have another drink.
The wahoo?
The wahoo moment?
I think so.
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.
You did all right dad.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
I love you dad.
Everything okay?
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
Government cutbacks.
We missed the deadline.
I don't think so.
I'm not sure.
I think so.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Sent it.
Sent it.
Yup.
Yes.
I think I forgot the tent.
I think so.
Why what?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
How could I know what else I forgot?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
What?
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
Are we going to do this again?
I wouldn't know.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
How do you figure?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
He is.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
Charles Moore for instants.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
He's weird.
He's weird.
Why? What's his problem?
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
It's vile!
I've seen it on television.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
Do you love me?
How much?
Kiss me...?
Problems?
Okay.
I'm not. What's the problem?
What kind of seats can we have?
So what do we do?
Go down where?
Honey I don't have the time...
We're leaving in three hours.
I'll call them from the road.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Will you please call the chair people?
Do you love me?
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Have a nice bachelor party.
Hi.
Not yet.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Well I do.
What are you doing?
Nesting?
I'm mad at you.
I'll see you tomorrow...
Hey. It's me.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
No. Just like an hour or so.
Okay.
What!
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
I'm working on it.
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
This is our honeymoon.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business.
Are they fighting?
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
No way.
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
We're not canceling.
I won't even discuss it.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Yeah. You.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
Yes.
No it's not okay. It's not.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
The prostitute.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
Micheal, by accident.
It's too late.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
But...
But...
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
He kept saying he was protected.
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
So what do we do?
Move the bodies?
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
What?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
It's my fucking opinion.
The hell you didn't!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Nope.
Your ideas never work out.
I don't hate women.
False.
Not true.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
New king.
Israel doesn't have a King.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
What's your point?
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
What? What's your point?
What?
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
Not really, no.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
You will not screw this up.
Ball park sausages.
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
We're not goosed.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
Goosed!
Goosed!
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
Well, I didn't mean it.
Who's up for making some real money?
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
I can't.
No.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
Nobody knows.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
Good God...Good God...
I'm calling the police.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
What kind of words?
Go ahead.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
You always were a jealous man.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
Shut up Boyd.
He's having a problem here.
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
He is not cracking up.
What did you ask me?
What is the question you asked me?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
Say it again.
What you just said. Say it again.
Exactly! Exactly my point.
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
Just do it.
Take care of business.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
What does that mean?
Yeah.
Hear what?
Now?
Isn't it a little late?
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
My what?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Okay fine.
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
You're sick.
Not a prayer.
You need help.
Fish?
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
Not tonight.
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
Left side.
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
Here's his head.
Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
I'm not talking to you?
What is her disposition?
Give me two more.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
Where is she?
Okay. Hi.
Who?
Yup.
That's right.
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
That's right.
Is everything okay?
She's in there!
What are you talking about?
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
Nothing happened in Vegas.
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
My god.
Money?
What does that mean?
Well, oh...
So where's that leave us?
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
No. I think it's fucked.
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
I won't do it.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
If anything ever happens to me...
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
What happened? Oh my God...
It has to be done.
What.
I don't think so.
Have you thought about what I said?
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
Where's the bathroom?
They're driving me nuts!
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
There is no candy!
I'm not getting a ticket.
You want to hear me out?
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
More.
She's got no fucking pulse.
Wait!
What are you doing?
What do you think you are doing?
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Why?  Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
Why?
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Are you sure this was an accident?
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
There's more.
Just giving the facts.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Sure, why not.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
So I didn't fucking do it!
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
What?
We've already done this.
How do you figure?
So that's what we're doing.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
We have to get going.
Alright. Let's do it.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
You got us into this mess.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Don't talk to me about character.
Fuck you Boyd!
What is your problem?
What?
Who? What are you talking about?
Nobody's smoking anybody out.
I don't give a damn.
Adam! Calm down.
It has worked.
They won't figure it out.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
First of all...
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
You're an asshole Adam.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Name one.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
The floor was wet. She slipped!
I don't know why the floor was wet!
Why?
This is pathetic.
What did you say?
Don't point at me.
I have plenty of friends.
The hell I don't.
What are you fucking talking about?
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
And you're a little fucking reject.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Go home!
What?
What did you say?
I didn't hear you.
Excellent.
I need a drink.
Don't touch her. Call 911.
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
But you said grey, sir.
She'll be out in a moment.
Yes! That's it!
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
Well...
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
By whom?
She died.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
What's tomorrow?
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
How do you know? Personal experience?
What do you mean?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I had to quit, Midge.
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
I know. Everybody tells me.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Well?... what'll you do?
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
From that music.
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
How's your love life, Midge?
Well?
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
Could be.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
My... the acrophobia.
I think I can lick it.
I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
That!?!
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Step number two.
Easy, now.
Johnny!
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Pop Leibel.
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
The poor thing....
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
Here you are.
I've told you enough.
Out. I've got things to do.
Out!
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Is she pretty?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Midge!
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
Just wander.
Around.
Mm. Better.
Yeah.
What was this desperate urge to see me?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
What I've been doing?
Naturally.
Wandering.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
What is it, a still life?
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
Yes... you run this hotel.
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
Would you please go and look?
Her car is gone.
Why am I here? What happened?
You don't remember.
Do you remember where you were?
Where were you?
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
When?
Oh... wandering about.
Please drink your coffee.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Wandering about.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
Some people prefer it.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
No... this is the first time for me, too.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
You've nothing to apologize for.
Not at all, I enjoyed --
I enjoyed talking to you.
No! No, thank you!
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
What?
We have.
Good-bye.
Shopping?
Well... anywhere in particular?
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
What are you thinking?
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Why?
Do you hear anything?
And no birds sing.
No.
No, thank you.
Madeleine!
Here with you.
The tall trees...
Yes...
Where were you born?
Where?
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
Why did you jump?
What was it inside that told you to jump?
What?!
Take me away from here?
...somewhere in the light.
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
Yesterday.
Vaguely...
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
No... it's in shadow.
A grave...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
I know.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
No.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
All the time.
Why? What's happened?
No, don't go away!
Where's your husband?
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Yes --
Tell me.
Go on.
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
It's all there. It's no dream.
No, never!
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
And it's a all real.
Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!
I love you too... too late... too late...
Too late... there's something I must do...
You can't.
Let me go.
To the church, I must go there.
Please let me go.
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Madeleine!!
Yes.
I won't lose you.
Why?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
What about?
Why?
You're not far wrong.
Let me come in.
You won't have to.
What do you want to know?
Judy Barton.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
It's a place to live, that's all.
About three years.
I told you! Right here!
Salina, Kansas!
I want to know who you are.
Will you have dinner with me?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Then will you for me?
Just dinner.
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
An hour?
Okay.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow morning.
Don't go.
I'll take care of you.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
No.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Yes.
No.
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
Please! And don't look at me.
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
I want to! Come on!
No, it's not right.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
They're none of them right.
You want me to dress like her?
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
I don't like it!
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
No, you wouldn't let me.  And I don't want to go...
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
You don't even want to touch me.
The color of your hair...
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
Yes.
Well?
We tried it. It didn't suit me.
Wherever you'd like...
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Mmmm.
Come here.
That's what I had in mind.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
Scottie!
Can't you see?
We're going awfully far.
No, it's all right.
To complete my cure.
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
Madeleine died here.
I need you.
I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
Scottie --
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow.
No! Let me go!
You can't. You're afraid!
Scottie, please...!
Yes!
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
We'll find him.
What are you going to do?
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
I loved you, Madeleine.
Love me... keep me safe...
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
What happened?
Hello?
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
I married into it.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
Almost a year.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
No, I'm all right.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
Then?
From whom?
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
I want you.
Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
That's Carlotta Valdes.
There are things you didn't tell me.
But you knew about this.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Nothing.
She is not my wife.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
I -- I --
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
He won't talk.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
How'm I doing so far?
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
Okay.  Now, so he's in jail.  He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake.  As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.   P.S.  He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink  and mopes around three and a half years.   You like that story?
Yes.
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
Yes, the roving nurse...
We, we were rather busy...
As I've said we had some more...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Yes.
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
Thanks, Franky.
Yeah.
That's for sure, Frank.
Hi.  How are you doing?
You live in the neighborhood?
How old is he?
Thank you.
Who told you that?
Mrs. Simmonds.
I used to be a nurse.
Kathy Price...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Yes.
Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
I did.
Yes.
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She did?
In New York?
You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
It's locked.
It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
... I'm sure you do ...
... I know.  I went ...
Yes.  Yes, I have.
... fifty thousand dollars?
... I understand ...
... I understand ...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
What do you want?
Don't touch anything.
...I'm going to need your help...
I'm going to help her.
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
...he's a good man...
...I have to stand up for her...
I have to try this case.  I have to do it, Mick.  I've got to stand up for that girl.  I need your help.    Mick, will you help me...?    Will you help me...?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
No.
Right.
Right.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
I'm going to get laid.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
So what?
They still have to take it to a jury.
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
Oh shit, what's today?
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
I can't talk now.
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
How are you holding up?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
That's right.
Are you with me...are you awake...?
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
What difference can that make...? All right...
What did she do?
The 'History'...?
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
The Hospital...?
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing in New York...?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
Dr. Gruber's not in.
He's not in, Sir.
I...please.  My wife...my wife's prescription has run out.  If I can call him...
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
The TV didn't work.
And what are you?  A cop?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Yes.  It was, actually.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Laura.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Maybe I can do something right.
That's what I'm going to try to do.
What...?
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
They, uh, they got to my witness.
I've got to work...
No, no, I'm just...
I've got to work.
You're going to stay here...?
Do you think it's my fault?
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
That's what I am.
Yes.
I...do you want me to leave?
I...
Who told you that?
And what makes you so tough?
Is there going to be a later...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
You, you don't under...
It's over!
What is that to you...?
Joe...  Joe...
You're pressuring yourself...
Yes.   We've all got to let go.
No.
I don't have a goddamned idea.
I have to talk to you.
Mr. Alito, please.
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
Let me talk to Mickey.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
From the magazine?
How come you're calling me from...?
Yes.  Price...
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
Missus...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
No.  At Chelsea Childcare.  Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey?  I'm late for work.
Why is that?
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket.  You follow me?  I'm trying to help you.
...things change.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
I'm sure you would.
Thank you for seeing me.
I need an extension for my case.
I had a witness disappear on me.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Defense...?
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
What?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Nothing further, your Honor...
I object, your Honor...
Exception!
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
No.
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I've got nothing to say to you.
Nothing happened.
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Who are you protecting, then?
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
Then why don't you testify?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
Yes?  Galvin, right?
That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
Yes.
Yes.
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
) I'm sorry ...?
Do you know who her doctors were?
The most respected ...
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
